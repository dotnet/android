	/// Represents a typed structure instance, derived from the <see cref="StructureInstance"/> class.  The slightly weird
	/// approach is because on one hand we need to operate on a heterogenous set of structures (in which generic types would
	/// only get in the way), but on the other hand we need to be able to get the structure type (whose instance is in
	/// <see cref="Obj"/> and <see cref="Instance"/>) only by looking at the **type**.  This is needed in situations when we have
	/// an array of some structures that is empty - we wouldn't be able to gleam the structure type from any instance and we still
	/// need to output a stronly typed LLVM IR declaration of the structure array.  With this class, most of the code will use the
	/// abstract <see cref="StructureInstance"/> type, and knowing we have only one non-abstract implementation of the class allows
	/// us to use StructureInstance&lt;T&gt; in a cast, to get <c>T</c> via reflection.
