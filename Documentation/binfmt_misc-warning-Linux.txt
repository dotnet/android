*************** WARNING ***************

Your Linux appears to have support for binfmt_misc kernel module enabled.
The module makes it possible to execute non-Linux binaries if the appropriate
interpreter for the given format is available.
Your machine is configured to handle Windows PE executables either via Mono or
Wine. It will make the .NET for Android build fail IF you choose to build the
Windows cross-compilers by enabling the 'mxe-Win32' or 'mxe-Win64' host targets.

You can disable the binfmt_misc module by issuing the following command as root
before building .NET for Android:

   echo 0 > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/status

and re-enable it after building wiht the following command:

   echo 1 > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/status

If you are on Ubuntu then you can disable just the CLI (Mono) and Wine interpreters
by issuing the following commands as root:

   update-binfmts --disable cli
   update-binfmts --disable wine
