# .NET for Android warning XA0101

## Issue

The normal `@(Content)` Build action is not supported (as we haven't figured
out how to support it without a possibly costly first-run step).

## Solution

If you wish to include additional content in your APK, such as textures
or audio for games, you should consider using `@(AndroidAsset)` or
`@(EmbeddedResource)`.
