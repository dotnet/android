# .NET for Android warning XA0112

## Issue

The AAPT2 command-line tool was not found.

## Solution

Check for any `<Aapt2ToolPath>` elements in the _.csproj_ file and
remove them. .NET for Android redistributes its own recommended version
of AAPT2, so setting a custom value for the `Aapt2ToolPath` MSBuild
property is generally not recommended. Alternatively, try re-installing
the .NET for Android workload in Visual Studio.

AAPT is part of the Android SDK and is used internally by
.NET for Android to process and compile resources into binary assets.
Learn more about AAPT and Android resources from the [Android
documentation][aapt].

AAPT2 is version 2.0 of AAPT. Learn more about AAPT2 from the
[Android documentation][aapt2].
