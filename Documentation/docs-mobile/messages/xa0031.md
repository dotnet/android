# .NET for Android error XA0031

## Issue

The Android SDK platform you are targeting only works with certain versions of Java.
If you get this error, it means either:

 1. You don't have a Java SDK installed, or
 2. Your Java SDK version is too old or is otherwise not compatible with the targeted
    Android platform.

## Solution

Make sure you install a compatible JDK version, such as the
[Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](/java/openjdk/download).

> [!NOTE]
> Java SDK 11.0 is required to use `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)` v12.0 (API-31) and later,
> and to use `$(TargetFramework)`=`net6.0-android31.0` in .NET 6 and later.
>
> [Use of Java SDK 11.0 will break the Android Designer in Visual Studio 16.11 and earlier](https://aka.ms/vs2019-and-jdk-11).

## Example messages

```
error XA0031: Java SDK 11.0 or above is required when using $(TargetFrameworkVersion) v12.0.
Download the latest JDK at: https://aka.ms/msopenjdk
Note: the Android Designer is incompatible with Java SDK 11.0: https://aka.ms/vs2019-and-jdk-11
```
