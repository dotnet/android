# .NET for Android error XA5301

## Issue

The XA5301 error is generated from a Windows [MAX_PATH][MAX_PATH]
failure: a file path over 260 characters was encountered somewhere
throughout the build.

Consider submitting a [bug][bug] if you are getting this failure under
normal circumstances.

## Solution

Rename your project to have a shorter name, or move the entire
solution to a shorter path.

For example:

```
C:\Users\MyReallyLongUsername\Desktop\Code\MyReallyLongSolutionName
```

May fit under the [MAX_PATH][MAX_PATH] limit if it was instead:

```
C:\Code\MyReallyLongSolutionName
```

Alternatively in recent versions of Windows 10, you can opt into long
paths via a [Local Group Policy][long_path] system-wide.
