# .NET for Android error ADB0060

## Example messages

```
error ADB0060: There is not enough storage space on the device to store package: {packageName}. Free up some space and try again.
```

```
error ADB0060: There is not enough storage space on the device to store package: {packageName}. Free up some space or use an SD card and try again.
```

## Issue

ADB0060 means that the internal or external disk space is full on
your Android emulator or device.

This message indicates that `adb` (Android Debug Bridge) reported an
INSTALL\_FAILED\_INSUFFICIENT\_STORAGE or
INSTALL\_FAILED\_MEDIA\_UNAVAILABLE error. `adb` is part of the Android
SDK and is used internally by .NET for Android to communicate with
Android emulators and devices. Learn more about `adb` from the [Android
documentation][adb].

## Solutions

Consider uninstalling applications or adding an SD card for additional
storage.

## Implementation notes

Note that nothing in the open source <https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android>
repository emits ADB0060, as features such as debugging and "fast deployment"
are implemented in the proprietary .NET for Android additions.
