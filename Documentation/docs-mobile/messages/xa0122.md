# .NET for Android warning XA0122

## Example messages

```
warning XA0122: Assembly 'Library1' is using a deprecated attribute '[assembly: Java.Interop.DoNotPackageAttribute]'. Use a newer version of this NuGet package or notify the library author.
```

## Issue

The behavior implemented in the `DoNotPackageAttribute` is deprecated:

```csharp
[assembly: Java.Interop.DoNotPackage ("foo.jar")]
```

This would prevent `foo.jar` from being packaged in the app.

Alternatively, you can use the `@(AndroidExternalJavaLibrary)` item
group for including `foo.jar`. The java library will only be used at
compile time, and will not be packaged in the final Android app.

## Solution

Some libraries using this feature can be simply updated to a newer
version on NuGet.

Library authors will need to remove usage of this attribute. Its
functionality will be removed in a future release.
