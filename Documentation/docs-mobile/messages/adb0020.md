# .NET for Android error ADB0020

## Example messages

```
error ADB0020: The package does not support the CPU architecture of this device.
```

## Issue

ADB0020 means that the built Android APK did not contain a matching
Android architecture for the emulator or device it was deployed to.

This message indicates that `adb` (Android Debug Bridge) reported an
INSTALL\_FAILED\_CPU\_ABI\_INCOMPATIBLE or
INSTALL\_FAILED\_NO\_MATCHING\_ABIS error. `adb` is part of the Android
SDK and is used internally by .NET for Android to communicate with
Android emulators and devices. Learn more about `adb` from the [Android
documentation][adb].

## Solution

A solution is to add an additional architecture under the
**Supported architectures** in your project options.

You may also modify the MSBuild property, as in the following example
that includes all ABIs:

```xml
<AndroidSupportedAbis>armeabi-v7a;x86;x86_64;arm64-v8a</AndroidSupportedAbis>
```

## Implementation notes

Note that nothing in the open source <https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android>
repository emits ADB0020, as features such as debugging and "fast deployment"
are implemented in the proprietary .NET for Android additions.
