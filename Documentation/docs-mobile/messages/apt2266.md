# .NET for Android error APT2266

## Example messages

```
error APT2266: Asset directories cannot use non ascii characters. This could be caused by the directory having non-ASCII characters in its filename or path. See https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/android/messages/apt2266 for details.
```

## Issue

The Full Path to the directory you are trying to use as an Asset Directory
contains non-ASCII characters. The `aapt2` tool has a known bug where it cannot traverse directories with non-ASCII characters [1].
This is commonly caused by users having non-ASCII characters in their usernames, or in the project folders.

## Solution

Rename the folder which contains non-ASCII characters to something which only has ASCII characters. If it is your username which has the non-ASCII
characters, the only solution is to move the project somewhere outside of
your user path. Most common solutions is to have a working or sandbox directory off the root of your drive rather than creating projects in `c:\Users\xxx`.
