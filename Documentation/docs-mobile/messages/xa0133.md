# .NET for Android error XA0133

## Issue

The 'run-as' tool required by the Fast Deployment system has been disabled on this device by the manufacturer. Please disable Fast Deployment in the Visual Studio project property pages or edit the project file in a text editor and set the 'EmbedAssembliesIntoApk' MSBuild property to 'true'.

## Solution

Unfortunately the manufacturer of the device has explicitly disabled the tool we need for Fast Deployment.
The only option currently is to disable Fast Deployment from the IDE or by setting the the 'EmbedAssembliesIntoApk' MSBuild property to 'true' in the csproj.
