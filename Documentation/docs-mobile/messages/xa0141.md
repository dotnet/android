# .NET for Android warning XA0141

## Issue

Future versions of Android on arm64 will require that native libraries use 16 KB page sizes.
This requires that the mentioned native libraries be recompiled, and all apps using those
native libraries be rebuilt to contain the fixed versions of the native libraries.

See the Android SDK [Support 16 KB page sizes](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes)
documentation for more information.

## Solution

The indicated native shared library must be recompiled and relinked with the 16k alignment, as per
the Android SDK [Support 16 KB page sizes](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes)
documentation.

## Example messages
