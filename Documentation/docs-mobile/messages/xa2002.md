# .NET for Android error XA2002

## Example messages

```
error XA2002: Can not resolve reference: `Library2`, referenced by `Library1`. Please add a NuGet package or assembly reference for `Library2`, or remove the reference to `Library1`.
```

## Issue

The project has a reference to `Library1`, and `Library1` has a transitive
dependency on `Library2`, but `Library2` could not be found using any of the
standard reference resolution lookup mechanisms.

## Solution

In some cases, such as for projects ported from another target platform to
.NET for Android, the `Library1` reference might no longer be relevant.  In those
cases, the reference to `Library1` can be removed.

In other cases, `Library2` might be available as a NuGet package or other
similar prebuilt library.  To resolve the error in those cases, add the
appropriate NuGet package or direct assembly reference to the project.

If neither of those possibilities applies, then `Library2` is likely a framework
class library assembly that is not available for .NET for Android.  In that case,
`Library1` is not compatible for use with .NET for Android.
