# .NET for Android error/warning APT2000

## Well-known APT2000 error messages

- `error APT2000: Invalid file name: must contain only [a-z0-9_.]`
- `error APT2000: Resource entry resource_name is already defined.`
- `error APT2000: No resource found that matches the given name (at 'resource_name' with value '@string/foo').`
- `error APT2000: invalid resource directory name: obj\Debug\dir with spaces "dir with spaces".`
- `warning APT2000: warning: string 'resource_name' has no default translation.`

## Issue

This message indicates that `aapt2` (Android Asset Packaging Tool) reported an error or warning. `aapt2` is part of the Android SDK and is used internally by .NET for Android to process and compile resources into binary assets.

Errors reported by `aapt2` are outside of .NET for Android's control, so a general error code of APT2000 is used reporting the exact message coming from `aapt2`.

## Solution

Reading the actual error message and looking at the diagnostic log output can
usually give you enough information to solve the issue yourself. It can be
helpful to do an internet search for the error message. Looking at solutions
which are for Java based Android applications can also help.

To learn more about `aapt2` and Android resources, see the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/accessing-resources.html).
