## Issue

Google has deprecated the DX DEX Compiler in favor of the [D8 DEX
Compiler][d8]. On [February 1, 2021][dx], DX will no longer be a part
of Android SDK or Android Studio.

The DX DEX Compiler will not supported in .NET 6 or higher, nor in
.NET for Android 12.4 and higher.

## Solution

Update the `$(AndroidDexTool)` MSBuild property to `d8` to select the
D8 DEX Compiler. This property corresponds to the **Dex compiler**
setting in the Visual Studio project properties pages. Alternatively,
remove `<AndroidDexTool>` from the _.csproj_ file to let the build
select the default value `d8`.
