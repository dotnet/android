# .NET for Android error/warning XA4312

Referencing an [Android Wear][0] application project from an Android
application project is deprecated.

From a `Foo.Android.csproj` in past versions of .NET for Android, you
could reference a `Foo.Wear.csproj` such as:

```xml
<ProjectReference Include="..\Foo.Wear\Foo.Wear.csproj">
  <IsAppExtension>True</IsAppExtension>
</ProjectReference>
```

This would embed `com.foo.wear.apk` *inside* `com.foo.android.apk` in
`Resources/raw`.

## Solution

Distribute `Foo.Wear.csproj` in the above example as a [standalone][1]
Android Wear application instead.
