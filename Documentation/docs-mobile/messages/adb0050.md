# .NET for Android error ADB0050

## Example messages

```
error ADB0050: Package {packageName} already exists on device.
```

## Issue

ADB0050 is likely an error in the .NET for Android build chain, since
it means there was an absence of the `-r` flag during the
`adb install` command.

This message indicates that `adb` (Android Debug Bridge) reported an
INSTALL\_FAILED\_ALREADY\_EXISTS error. `adb` is part of the Android SDK
and is used internally by .NET for Android to communicate with Android
emulators and devices. Learn more about `adb` from the [Android
documentation][adb].

## Solution

Consider submitting a [bug][bug] if you are getting this warning under
normal circumstances.

## Implementation notes

Note that nothing in the open source <https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android>
repository emits ADB0050, as features such as debugging and "fast deployment"
are implemented in the proprietary .NET for Android additions.
