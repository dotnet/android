## XA6xxx: Internal tools

## XAccc7xxx: Unhandled MSBuild Exceptions

Exceptions that have not been gracefully handled yet.  Ideally these will be fixed or replaced with better errors in the future.

These take the form of `XACCC7NNN`, where `CCC` is a 3 character code denoting the MSBuild Task that is throwing the exception,
and `NNN` is a 3 digit number indicating the type of the unhandled `Exception`.
