# .NET for Android warning XA4306

## Issue

[d8/r8][r8_source] does not support using custom `multidex.keep` files
if `minSdkVersion` >= 21, e.g. devices where native multidex is
supported. In theses cases, d8/r8 calculates the contents of the main
`classes.dex` without rules specified by developers.

[This change][r8_commit] in d8/r8 appeared in version 1.4.93.

## Solution

Verify you are not declaring any `MultiDexMainDexList` build items.

Consider submitting a [bug][bug] if your application does not function
after removing any `MultiDexMainDexList` items.
