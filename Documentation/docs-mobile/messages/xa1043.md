# .NET for Android warning XA1043

## Example messages

```
The 'AndroidHttpClientHandlerType' property is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of .NET for Android. The property value 'System.Net.Http.SocketsHttpHandler, System.Net.Http' will be used, but the recommended approach is to remove the property and pass a custom HTTP handler to the HttpClient constructor if needed.
```

## Issue

The `AndroidHttpClientHandlerType` MSBuild property is deprecated because it relies on runtime type name resolution which is not compatible with trimming and ahead-of-time compilation. While the property still works for MonoVM and CoreCLR runtimes, it will be removed in a future version of .NET for Android.

## Solution

Remove the `AndroidHttpClientHandlerType` property from your project file.

If you need to use a custom HTTP message handler, pass it directly to the `HttpClient` constructor:

```csharp
var handler = new MyCustomHttpHandler();
var client = new HttpClient(handler);
```

This approach is compatible with all .NET for Android runtimes including NativeAOT, CoreCLR, and MonoVM, and works correctly with trimming and ahead-of-time compilation.
