# .NET for Android error/warning ANDKT0000

## Issue

This message indicates that the Java `keytool` command line tool used by
.NET for Android reported an error or warning.

Errors reported by `keytool` and other Android command line tooling are
outside of .NET for Android's control, so a general error code of
ANDKT0000 is used reporting the exact message.

## Solution

To learn more about `keytool` and its usage, see the Java documentation
[here][keytool].

[keytool]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/keytool.html
