# .NET for Android error XA1003

## Issue

This error will be emitted if the expected *.zip* file is not
found when compiling the Java code to Dalvik. As part of the
build process, all the *.class* files will be zipped up into a
*classes.zip* file. This file is then used by the Dalvik compiler
to produce the code for the final application.

If the *classes.zip* file is missing, it is likely you have an
error earlier in the build process.

## Solution

Please **Clean** and **Build** your application again to correct
this issue.

If the problem persists, raise an [issue](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/new).
