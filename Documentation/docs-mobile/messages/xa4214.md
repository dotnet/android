# .NET for Android warning XA4214

## Example messages

```
warning XA4214: The managed type `Library1.Class1` exists in multiple assemblies: Library1, Library2. Please refactor the managed type names in these assemblies so that they are not identical.
warning XA4214: References to the type `Library1.Class1` will refer to `Library1.Class1, Library1`.
```

## Issue

If two or more C# types from different assemblies inherit from
`Java.Lang.Object` and share the same fully qualified name, that name will
always refer to just *one* of the types when used in Android resource files.

## Solution

The typical way to resolve this warning is to rename the types so that each
fully qualified name only exists in one assembly.

Another option is to add `[Register]` attributes on the conflicting managed
types so that each one has a unique Java type name.

A third option is to qualify the type names with the assembly name in the
Android resource files.  For example, use the assembly-qualified name
`Library1.Class1, Library` rather than just `Library1.Class1`.  This only works
in places where the XML schema allows a type name within an XML attribute.  One
example is the `class` attribute on `fragment` elements.

If you choose to use `[Register]` attributes or assembly-qualified names rather
than renaming the managed types, then you can hide the warnings either by adding
the `/warnasmessage:XA4214` switch to the MSBuild command line or by adding
`XA4214` to the `$(MSBuildWarningsAsMessages)` property in your .csproj file:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <MSBuildWarningsAsMessages>XA4214</MSBuildWarningsAsMessages>
</PropertyGroup>
```
