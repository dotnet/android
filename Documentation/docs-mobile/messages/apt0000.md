## Issue

This message indicates that `aapt` (Android Asset Packaging Tool) reported an error or warning. `aapt` is part of the Android SDK and is used internally by .NET for Android to process and compile resources into binary assets.

Errors reported by `aapt` are outside of .NET for Android's control, so a general error code of APT0000 is used reporting the exact message coming from `aapt`.

## Solution

To learn more about `aapt` and Android resources, see the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/accessing-resources.html).
