# .NET for Android error ADB0040

## Example messages

```
error ADB0040: The device does not support the minimum SDK level specified in the manifest.
```

## Issue

ADB0040 means that you are trying to deploy to an emulator or device
that has an older Android version than what your .NET for Android
application supports.

This message indicates that `adb` (Android Debug Bridge) reported an
INSTALL\_FAILED\_OLDER\_SDK error. `adb` is part of the Android SDK and
is used internally by .NET for Android to communicate with Android
emulators and devices. Learn more about `adb` from the [Android
documentation][adb].

## Solution

Verify you are setting the appropriate values for `uses-sdk` in your
*AndroidManifest.xml*:

```xml
<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="15" android:targetSdkVersion="27"/>
```

Your attached device must at least be able to support `minSdkVersion`.

## Implementation notes

Note that nothing in the open source <https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android>
repository emits ADB0040, as features such as debugging and "fast deployment"
are implemented in the proprietary .NET for Android additions.
