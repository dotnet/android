# .NET for Android error XA0004

## Issue

This error means the value for `android:versionCode` in the 
`AndroidManifest.xml` file is and integer but is not 
within the value range of 0 to 2100000000.

Google requires that the value be an integer within the 
range of 0 to 2100000000. 
See [https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning)
for more details.

## Solution

Correct the `android:versionCode` in the `AndroidManifest.xml` to 
be an integer in the range of 0 to 2100000000.
