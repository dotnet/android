# .NET for Android error XA1025

## Example messages

```
error XA1025: The experimental 'Hybrid' value for the 'AndroidAotMode' MSBuild
property is not currently compatible with the armeabi-v7a target ABI. To
continue using the experimental 'Hybrid' value for 'AndroidAotMode', deselect
the armeabi-v7a target ABI in the Visual Studio project property pages or edit
the project file in a text editor and remove 'armeabi-v7a' from the
'AndroidSupportedAbis' MSBuild property.
```

## Issue

The project has the `AndroidAotMode` MSBuild property set to the experimental
`Hybrid` value and also includes the value `armeabi-v7a` in the
`AndroidSupportedAbis` MSBuild property.  Applications built with
`AndroidAotMode` set to `Hybrid` currently abort during startup on armeabi-v7a
devices, so the build exits with an error if this configuration is found.

## Solution

If armeabi-v7a device compatibility is required for the app, the
`AndroidAotMode` MSBuild property should be set to `Normal` or removed from the
project file completely.  To adjust the value of the `AndroidAotMode` MSBuild
property, edit the project file in a text editor.

If armeabi-v7a device compatibility is not required for the app, then deselect
the **armeabi-v7a** target ABI in the Visual Studio project property pages to
resolve the build error.

In Visual Studio, the target ABIs can be adjusted under **Supported
architectures** in the **Advanced** section of the **Android Options** tab of
the project property pages

In Visual Studio for Mac, the target ABIs can be adjusted under **Supported
ABIs** in the **Advanced** tab of the **Android Build** section of the project
property pages.

Alternatively, edit the project file in a text editor and remove `armeabi-v7a`
from the `AndroidSupportedAbis` MSBuild property by hand.
