# .NET for Android error XA1004

## Example messages

```
There was an error opening {filename}. The file is probably corrupt.
Try deleting it and building again.
```

## Issue

This usually happens if the download of the *.zip* or *.aar* file was incomplete.

## Solution

The best thing to do is to try to delete the file and do a clean build.

If the problem persists, raise an [issue](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/new).
