# .NET for Android error XA0127

## Issue

If you encounter this issue something unexpected happened with the Fast Deployment
native tooling. This is most likely to be a native crash.

## Solution

To work around the issue disable Fast Deployment by setting  `EmbedAssembliesIntoApk = True`
in your .csproj. Or turn off `Fast Deployment` in the IDE. You will still be able to debug
on the device, all the required files will be packaged inside the .apk.

In addition raise an issue at [https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/new/choose](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/new/choose). Please provide the deployment log and as much detail as possible.
