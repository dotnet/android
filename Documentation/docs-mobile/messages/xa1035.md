# .NET for Android warning XA1035

## Example messages

```
The 'BundleAssemblies' property is deprecated and it has no effect on the application build. Equivalent functionality is implemented by the 'AndroidUseAssemblyStore' and 'AndroidEnableAssemblyCompression' properties.
```

## Solution

Edit your csproj directly and remove the 'BundleAssemblies' property.
`AndroidUseAssemblyStore` and `AndroidEnableAssemblyCompression` are
both enabled by default and, together, they implement behavior
equivalent to that of `BundleAssemblies`.
