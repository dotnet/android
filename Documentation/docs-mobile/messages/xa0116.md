# .NET for Android error XA0116

## Issue

.NET for Android's build process extracts various `EmbeddedResource`
files from its assemblies during a build. These include internal Java
source files that are required for a .NET for Android application to
start successfully. A XA0116 error would only be encountered if one
of these required files is missing.

## Solution

normal circumstances.
