# .NET for Android warning XA0117

## Issue

As the Android platform evolves certain versions will be deprecated and
removed. How we decide if a platform is deprecated largely depends on whether
the [Android NDK][ndk] continues to support the platform in question.
It also depends on whether the
[Android Support Libraries support that platform][support].

If both the Android NDK and the Android Support Libraries have removed support
for a particular `apiLevel`, then it is highly likely that support for the
API level will be deprecated and removed from .NET for Android.

If you are seeing this warning, it is because your `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)`
is set to a value which is likely to be deprecated in the near future.

## Solution

To remove this warning, update your `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)` to use
the latest stable platform.

Your `android:minSdk` value within *AndroidManifest.xml* can still mention
older versions of the android platform.
