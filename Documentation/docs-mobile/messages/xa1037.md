# .NET for Android warning XA1037

## Example messages

```
The '_AndroidUseJavaLegacyResolver' MSBuild property is deprecated and will be removed in .NET 10. 
See https://aka.ms/net-android-deprecations for more details.
```

## Solution

Edit your csproj directly and remove the referenced MSBuild property.

Test your project to ensure the new behavior is functionally equivalent.

If not, file an [issue](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues) so a 
solution can be found before the deprecated flag is removed.
