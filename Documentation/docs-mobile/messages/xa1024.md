# .NET for Android warning XA1024

## Example messages

```
warning XA1024: Ignoring configuration file 'Foo.dll.config'. .NET configuration files are not supported in .NET for Android projects that target .NET 6 or higher.
```

## Issue

No support for [configuration files][config] such as `Foo.dll.config`
or `Foo.exe.config` is available in .NET for Android projects.
[`<dllmap>`][dllmap] configuration elements are not
supported in .NET 6 at all, and other element types for compatibility
packages like [System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager][nuget] have
never been supported in .NET for Android projects.

[config]: /dotnet/framework/configure-apps/
[nuget]: https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager/

## Solution

Use a supported alternative for [`<dllmap>`][dllmap], such as the
[NativeLibrary][native] API.

Use an alternative for application settings such as
[Preferences][preferences] in Xamarin.Essentials.
