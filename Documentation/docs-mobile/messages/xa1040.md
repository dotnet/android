# .NET for Android warning XA1040

## Example messages

```
warning XA1040: The CoreCLR runtime is currently experimental in .NET for Android.
warning XA1040: The NativeAOT runtime is currently experimental in .NET for Android.
```

## Issue

MonoVM is the default, supported runtime for .NET for Android.

Other runtimes are currently experimental, such as:

* CoreCLR, used via `$(UseMonoRuntime)=false`
* NativeAOT, used via `$(PublishAot)=true`

## Solution

To silence this warning, you can either:

* Use MonoVM by removing `$(UseMonoRuntime)=false` or
  `$(PublishAot)=true` from your project file.

* Set `$(AndroidAllowExperimentalRuntime)` to `true` in your project
  file.
