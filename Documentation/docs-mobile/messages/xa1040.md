# .NET for Android warning XA1040

## Example messages

```
warning XA1040: The NativeAOT runtime on Android is an experimental feature and not yet suitable for production use. File issues at: https://github.com/dotnet/android/issues
```

## Issue

NativeAOT is an experimental runtime option for .NET for Android. When you enable NativeAOT via `$(PublishAot)=true`, this warning is emitted to indicate that NativeAOT is not yet suitable for production use.

The supported runtimes are:

* CoreCLR (default)
* MonoVM, used via `$(UseMonoRuntime)=true`

## Solution

To silence this warning, you can either:

* Use a supported runtime by removing `$(PublishAot)=true` from your project file.

* Set `$(EnablePreviewFeatures)` to `true` in your project file to acknowledge the experimental nature of NativeAOT.
