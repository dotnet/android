# .NET for Android warning XA1040

## Example messages

```
warning XA1040: The NativeAOT runtime on Android is an experimental feature and not yet suitable for production use. File issues at: https://github.com/dotnet/android/issues
```

## Issue

CoreCLR is the default, supported runtime for .NET for Android. Mono is also supported.

You can opt into other runtimes via:

* CoreCLR, default
* MonoVM, used via `$(UseMonoRuntime)=true`
* NativeAOT, used via `$(PublishAot)=true`

## Solution

To silence this warning, you can either:

* Use CoreCLR by removing `$(PublishAot)=true` from your project file.

* Set `$(EnablePreviewFeatures)` to `true` in your project file.
