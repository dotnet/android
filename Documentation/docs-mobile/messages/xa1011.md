# .NET for Android error XA1011

## Example messages

```
error XA1011: Using ProGuard with the D8 DEX compiler is no longer supported. Please set the code shrinker to 'r8' in the Visual Studio project property pages or edit the project file in a text editor and set the 'AndroidLinkTool' MSBuild property to 'r8'.
```

## Issue

The project is currently configured to use the D8 DEX compiler in combination
with the ProGuard code shrinker.  In the past, using the ProGuard code shrinker
with the D8 DEX compiler was allowed, but now, only the R8 code shrinker is
supported for use with the D8 DEX compiler.

## Solution

Set the **Code shrinker** in the Visual Studio project properties pages to
**r8**, or edit the project file [in Visual Studio][edit-project-files] or
another text editor and set the `AndroidLinkTool` MSBuild property to `r8`:

```xml
<PropertyGroup Condition=" '$(Configuration)|$(Platform)' == 'Release|AnyCPU' ">
  <AndroidLinkTool>r8</AndroidLinkTool>
</PropertyGroup>
```

R8 might in some cases produce new build warnings or errors compared to
ProGuard, so the ProGuard rules for the project might require a few updates to
resolve any new warnings or errors that appear after this change.
