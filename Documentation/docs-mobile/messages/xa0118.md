# .NET for Android warning XA0118

## Issue

These warnings indicate an issue with the `$(NuGetTargetMoniker)` MSBuild
property in a .NET for Android project. This property is normally generated
automatically based on the `$(TargetFrameworkIdentifier)` and
`$(TargetFrameworkVersion)` properties, so these warnings should not arise in
normal use.

## Solution

Consider submitting a [bug][bug] if you are getting one of these warnings under
normal circumstances.
