# .NET for Android error XA0136

## Issue

The 'run-as' command failed with '{0}'.

## Solution

The currently installation of the package in corrupt. Please manually uninstall the
package from all the users on device and try again. If that does not work you can disable Fast Deployment.
Fast Deployment can be disabled in the Visual Studio project property pages or edit the project file in a text editor and set the 'EmbedAssembliesIntoApk' MSBuild property to 'true'.
