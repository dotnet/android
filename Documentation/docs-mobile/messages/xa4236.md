# .NET for Android error XA4236

## Example message

```
error XA4236: Cannot download Maven artifact 'com.example:mylib'.
error XA4236: - mylib-1.0.0.jar: Response status code does not indicate success: 404 (Not Found).
error XA4236: - mylib-1.0.0.aar: Response status code does not indicate success: 404 (Not Found).
```

## Issue

Errors were encountered while trying to download the requested Java library from Maven.

For example the following item doesn't actually exist on Maven Central, resulting in "Not Found":

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <AndroidMavenLibrary Include="com.example:mylib" Version="1.0.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Solution

Resolving this error depends on the error message specified.

It could be things like:
- Check your internet connection.
- Ensure you have specified the correct group id and artifact id.
- Ensure you have specified the correct Maven repository.
