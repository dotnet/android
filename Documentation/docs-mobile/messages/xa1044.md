# .NET for Android warning XA1044

## Example messages

```
The 'XA_HTTP_CLIENT_HANDLER_TYPE' environment variable is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of .NET for Android. Remove the environment variable from your @(AndroidEnvironment) files. To use a custom HTTP handler, pass it to the HttpClient constructor.
```

## Issue

The `XA_HTTP_CLIENT_HANDLER_TYPE` environment variable is deprecated because it relies on runtime type name resolution which is not compatible with trimming and ahead-of-time compilation.

This warning is raised when the build system detects that an `@(AndroidEnvironment)` file contains the `XA_HTTP_CLIENT_HANDLER_TYPE` environment variable.

## Solution

Remove the `XA_HTTP_CLIENT_HANDLER_TYPE` environment variable from your `@(AndroidEnvironment)` files.

If you need to use a custom HTTP message handler, pass it directly to the `HttpClient` constructor:

```csharp
var handler = new MyCustomHttpHandler();
var client = new HttpClient(handler);
```

This approach is compatible with all .NET for Android runtimes including NativeAOT, CoreCLR, and MonoVM, and works correctly with trimming and ahead-of-time compilation.
