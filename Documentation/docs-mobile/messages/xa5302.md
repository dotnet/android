# .NET for Android warning XA5302

## Issue

The XA5302 warning is generated if we detect MSBuild building the
project multiple times in parallel.

You should not encounter this under normal circumstances in IDEs or at
the command-line.

## Solution

You could also encounter this warning if MSBuild crashes, suffer power
loss, etc. You can safely delete the file mentioned in the warning
message as a last resort.

Consider submitting a [bug][bug] if you are getting this failure under
normal circumstances.
