# Build properties

MSBuild properties control the behavior of the
[targets](build-targets.md).

They're specified within the project file, for example **MyApp.csproj**, within
an [MSBuild PropertyGroup](/visualstudio/msbuild/propertygroup-element-msbuild).

> [!NOTE]
> In .NET for Android there is technically no distinction between an application and a bindings project, so properties will work in both. In practice it is highly recommended to create separate application and bindings projects. Properties that are primarily used in bindings projects are documented in the [MSBuild bindings project properties](../binding-libs/msbuild-reference/build-properties.md) reference guide.

## AdbTarget

The `$(AdbTarget)` property specifies the Android target device the
Android package may be installed to or removed from.
The value of this property is the same as the
[`adb` Target Device option](https://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html#issuingcommands).

## AfterGenerateAndroidManifest

MSBuild Targets listed in this
property will run directly after the internal `_GenerateJavaStubs`
target, which is where the `AndroidManifest.xml` file is generated
in the `$(IntermediateOutputPath)`. If you want to make any
modifications to the generated `AndroidManifest.xml` file, you can
do that using this extension point.

## AndroidAapt2CompileExtraArgs

Specifies
command-line options to pass to the **aapt2 compile** command when
processing Android assets and resources.

## AndroidAapt2LinkExtraArgs

Specifies
command-line options to pass to the **aapt2 link** command when
processing Android assets and resources.

## AndroidAddKeepAlives

A boolean property that controls whether the linker will insert
`GC.KeepAlive()` invocations within binding projects to prevent premature
object collection.

The default value is `True` for Release configuration builds.

## AndroidAotAdditionalArguments

A string property that allows
passing options to the Mono compiler during the `Aot`
task for projects that have either
[`$(AndroidEnableProfiledAot)`](#androidenableprofiledaot) or
[`$(AotAssemblies)`](#aotassemblies) set to `true`.
The string value of the property is added to the response file when
calling the Mono cross-compiler.

In general, this property should be left blank, but in certain
special scenarios it might provide useful flexibility.

The `$(AndroidAotAdditionalArguments)` property is different from the related
[`$(AndroidExtraAotOptions)`](#androidextraaotoptions) property;
`$(AndroidAotAdditionalArguments)` passes full standalone space-separated options
like `--verbose` or `--debug` to the AOT compiler, while
`$(AndroidExtraAotOptions)` contains comma-separated arguments which are part of
the `--aot` option of the AOT compiler.

## AndroidAotCustomProfilePath

The file that `aprofutil` should create to hold profiler data.

## AndroidAotProfiles

A string property that allows the
developer to add AOT profiles from the command line. It's a
semicolon or comma-separated list of absolute paths.

## AndroidAotProfilerPort

The port that `aprofutil` should connect to when obtaining profiling data.

## AndroidAotEnableLazyLoad

Enable lazy (delayed) loading of AOT-d assemblies, instead of
preloading them at the startup.  The default value is `True` for Release builds
with any form of AOT enabled.

Introduced in .NET 6.

## AndroidApkDigestAlgorithm

A string value that specifies
the digest algorithm to use with `jarsigner -digestalg`.

The default value is `SHA-256`.

## AndroidApkSignerAdditionalArguments

A string property that allows
the developer to provide arguments to the `apksigner` tool.

## AndroidApkSigningAlgorithm

A string value that specifies
the signing algorithm to use with `jarsigner -sigalg`.

The default value is `SHA256withRSA`.

## AndroidApplication

A boolean value that indicates
whether the project is for an Android Application (`True`) or for
an Android Library Project (`False` or not present).

Only one project with
`<AndroidApplication>True</AndroidApplication>` may be present
within an Android package. (Unfortunately this requirement isn't verified,
which can result in subtle and bizarre errors regarding Android
resources.)

## AndroidApplicationJavaClass

The full Java class name to
use in place of `android.app.Application` when a class inherits
from [Android.App.Application](xref:Android.App.Application).

The `$(AndroidApplicationJavaClass)` property is generally set by
*other* properties, such as the [`$(AndroidEnableMultiDex)`](#androidenablemultidex) MSBuild property.

## AndroidAvoidEmitForPerformance

A boolean property that determines whether or not `System.Reflection.Emit` is
"avoided" to improve startup performance. This property is `True` by default.

Usage of `System.Reflection.Emit` has a noticeable impact on startup performance
on Android. This behavior is disabled by default for the following feature
switches:

* `Switch.System.Reflection.ForceInterpretedInvoke`: after the second call to
  `MethodInfo.Invoke()` or `ConstructorInfo.Invoke()`, code is emitted to
  improve performance of repeated calls.

* `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.DisableDynamicEngine`: after the
  second call to retrieve a service from a dependency injection container, code
  is emitted to improve performance of repeated calls.

It is desirable in most Android applications to disable this behavior.

See the [Base Class Libraries Feature Switches documentation][feature-switches]
for details about available feature switches.

Added in .NET 8.

[feature-switches]: /dotnet/core/deploying/trimming/trimming-options?pivots=dotnet-8-0#trim-framework-library-features

## AndroidBinUtilsPath

A path to a directory containing
the Android [binutils][binutils] such as `ld`, the native linker,
and `as`, the native assembler. These tools are included in the
.NET for Android workload.

The default value is `$(MonoAndroidBinDirectory)\binutils\bin\`.

[binutils]: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android-binutils/

## AndroidBoundExceptionType

A string value that specifies how
exceptions should be propagated when a .NET for Android-provided type
implements a .NET type or interface in terms of Java types, for example
`Android.Runtime.InputStreamInvoker` and `System.IO.Stream`, or
`Android.Runtime.JavaDictionary` and `System.Collections.IDictionary`.

- `Java`: The original Java exception type is propagated as-is.

  `Java` means that, for example, `InputStreamInvoker` doesn't properly implement
  the `System.IO.Stream` API because `Java.IO.IOException` may be thrown
  from `Stream.Read()` instead of `System.IO.IOException`.

- `System`: The original Java exception type is caught and wrapped in an
  appropriate .NET exception type.

  `System` means that, for example, `InputStreamInvoker` properly implements
  `System.IO.Stream`, and `Stream.Read()` will *not* throw `Java.IO.IOException`
  instances.  (It may instead throw a `System.IO.IOException` containing a
  `Java.IO.IOException` as the `Exception.InnerException` value.)

  `System` is the default value.

## AndroidBoundInterfacesContainConstants

A boolean property that
determines whether binding constants on interfaces will be supported,
or the workaround of creating an `IMyInterfaceConsts` class
will be used.

The default value is `True`.

## AndroidBoundInterfacesContainStaticAndDefaultInterfaceMethods

A boolean property that
whether default and static members on interfaces will be supported,
or  old workaround of creating a sibling class containing static
members like `abstract class MyInterface`.

The default value is `True` in .NET 6 and `False` for legacy.

## AndroidBoundInterfacesContainTypes

A boolean property that
whether types nested in interfaces will be supported, or the workaround
of creating a non-nested type like `IMyInterfaceMyNestedClass`.

The default value is `True` in .NET 6 and `False` for legacy.

## AndroidBuildApplicationPackage

A boolean value that
indicates whether to create and sign the package (.apk). Setting
this value to `True` is equivalent to using the
[`SignAndroidPackage`](build-targets.md#install)
build target.

This property is `False` by default.

## AndroidBundleConfigurationFile

Specifies a filename to use as a
[configuration file][bundle-config-format] for `bundletool`
when building an Android App Bundle. This file controls some aspects
of how APKs are generated from the bundle, such as on what
dimensions the bundle is split to produce APKs.
.NET for Android configures some of these settings automatically,
including the list of file extensions to leave uncompressed.

This property is only relevant if
[`$(AndroidPackageFormat)`](#androidpackageformat) is set to `aab`.

[bundle-config-format]: https://developer.android.com/studio/build/building-cmdline#bundleconfig

## AndroidBundleToolExtraArgs

Specifies
command-line options to pass to the **bundletool** command when
build app bundles.

## AndroidClassParser

A string property that controls how
`.jar` files are parsed. Possible values include:

- **class-parse**: Uses `class-parse.exe` to parse Java bytecode
  directly, without assistance of a JVM.

- **jar2xml**: this value is obsolete and is no longer supported.

## AndroidCodegenTarget

A string property that controls the code generation target ABI.
Possible values include:

- **XamarinAndroid**: this value is obsolete and is no longer supported.

- **XAJavaInterop1**: Use Java.Interop for JNI invocations. Binding
  assemblies using `XAJavaInterop1` can only build and execute with
  Xamarin.Android 6.1 or later. Xamarin.Android 6.1 and later bind
  `Mono.Android.dll` with this value.

The default value is `XAJavaInterop1`.

## AndroidCreatePackagePerAbi

A boolean property that determines if a *set* of files--one per ABI
specified in [`$(AndroidSupportedAbis)`](#androidsupportedabis)--should
be created instead of having support for all ABIs in a single `.apk`.

See also the [Building ABI-Specific APKs](/xamarin/android/deploy-test/building-apps/abi-specific-apks)
guide.

## AndroidCreateProguardMappingFile

A boolean property that controls if a proguard mapping file is
generated as part of the build process.

Adding the following to your csproj will cause the file to be
generated, and uses the [`AndroidProguardMappingFile`](#androidproguardmappingfile) property
to control the location of the final mapping file.

```xml
<AndroidCreateProguardMappingFile>True</AndroidCreateProguardMappingFile>
```

When producing `.aab` files, the mapping file is
automatically included in your package. There is no need to upload
it to the Google Play Store manually. When using `.apk` files, the
[`AndroidProguardMappingFile`](#androidproguardmappingfile) will need to be
manually uploaded.

The default value is `True` when using [`$(AndroidLinkTool)`](#androidlinktool)=r8.

## AndroidDebugKeyAlgorithm

Specifies the default
algorithm to use for the `debug.keystore`. The default value is
`RSA`.

## AndroidDebugKeyValidity

Specifies the default
validity to use for the `debug.keystore`. The default value is
`10950` or `30 * 365` or `30 years`.

## AndroidDebugStoreType

Specifies the
key store file format to use for the `debug.keystore`. It defaults
to `pkcs12`.


## AndroidDeviceUserId

Allows deploying and debugging the application under guest
or work accounts. The value is the `uid` value you get
from the following adb command:

```shell
adb shell pm list users
```

The above command will return the following data:

```
Users:
	UserInfo{0:Owner:c13} running
	UserInfo{10:Guest:404}
```

The `uid` is the first integer value. In the above output,
they're `0` and `10`.

## AndroidDexTool

An enum-style property with a valid
value of `d8`. _Previously, a value of `dx` was supported in
Xamarin.Android._

Indicates which Android [dex][dex]
compiler is used during the .NET for Android build process.
The default value is `d8`. See our
documentation on [D8 and R8][d8-r8].

[dex]: https://source.android.com/devices/tech/dalvik/dalvik-bytecode
[d8-r8]: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/blob/main/Documentation/guides/D8andR8.md

## AndroidEnableDesugar

A boolean property that
determines if `desugar` is enabled. Android doesn't currently
support all Java 8 features, and the default toolchain implements
the new language features by performing bytecode transformations,
called `desugar`, on the output of the `javac` compiler. The default value is
`False` if using `$(AndroidDexTool)=dx` and `True` if
using [`$(AndroidDexTool)`](#androiddextool)=`d8`.

## AndroidEnableGooglePlayStoreChecks

A bool property
that allows developers to disable the following Google Play
Store checks: XA1004, XA1005 and XA1006. Disabling these checks is useful for
developers who are not targeting the Google Play Store and do
not wish to run those checks.

## AndroidEnableMarshalMethods

A bool property, that determines whether or not LLVM marshal methods are enabled.
LLVM marshal methods are an app startup optimization which uses native entry points
for Java `native` method registration.

This property is False by default.

Added in .NET 8.

## AndroidEnableMultiDex

A boolean property that
determines whether or not multi-dex support will be used in the
final `.apk`.

This property is `False` by default.

## AndroidEnableObsoleteOverrideInheritance

A boolean property that determines if bound methods automatically inherit `[Obsolete]`
attributes from methods they override.

Support for this property was added in .NET 8.

This property is `True` by default.

## AndroidEnablePreloadAssemblies

A boolean property that controls
whether or not all managed assemblies bundled within the application package
are loaded during process startup or not.

When set to `True`, all assemblies bundled within the application package
will be loaded during process startup, before any application code is invoked.

When set to `False`, assemblies will only be loaded on an as-needed basis.
Loading assemblies on an as-needed basis allows applications to launch faster,
and is also more consistent with desktop .NET semantics.
To see the time savings, set the `debug.mono.log`
System Property to include `timing`, and look for the
`Finished loading assemblies: preloaded` message within `adb logcat`.

Applications or libraries, which use dependency injection may *require* that
this property be `True` if they in turn require that
`AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies()` return all assemblies within the
application bundle, even if the assembly wouldn't otherwise have been needed.

By default this value is False.

## AndroidEnableProfiledAot

A boolean property that
determines whether or not the AOT profiles are used during
Ahead-of-Time compilation.

The profiles are listed in
[`@(AndroidAotProfile)`](build-items.md#androidaotprofile)
item group. This ItemGroup contains default profile(s). It can be overridden by
removing the existing one(s) and adding your own AOT profiles.

This property is `False` by default.


## AndroidEnableRestrictToAttributes

An enum-style property with valid values of `obsolete` and `disable`.

When set to `obsolete`, types and members that are marked with the Java annotation 
`androidx.annotation.RestrictTo` *or* are in non-exported Java packages will 
be marked with an `[Obsolete]` attribute in the C# binding.

This `[Obsolete]` attribute has a descriptive message explaining that the
Java package owner considers the API to be "internal" and warns against its use.

This attribute also has a custom warning code `XAOBS001` so that it can be suppressed
independently of "normal" obsolete API.

When set to `disable`, API will be generated as normal with no additional
attributes. (This is the same behavior as before .NET 8.)

Adding `[Obsolete]` attributes instead of automatically removing the API was done to 
preserve API compatibility with existing packages. If you would instead prefer to 
*remove* members that have the `@RestrictTo` annotation *or* are in non-exported 
Java packages, you can use [Transform files](/xamarin/android/platform/binding-java-library/customizing-bindings/java-bindings-metadata#metadataxml-transform-file) in addition to
this property to prevent these types from being bound:

```xml
<remove-node path="//*[@annotated-visibility]" />
```

Support for this property was added in .NET 8.

This property is set to `obsolete` by default.

## AndroidEnableSGenConcurrent

A boolean property that
determines whether or not Mono's
[concurrent GC collector](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/releases/4.8.0/#concurrent-sgen)
will be used.

This property is `False` by default.

## AndroidErrorOnCustomJavaObject

A boolean property that
determines whether types may implement `Android.Runtime.IJavaObject`
*without* also inheriting from `Java.Lang.Object` or `Java.Lang.Throwable`:

```csharp
class BadType : IJavaObject {
    public IntPtr Handle {
        get {return IntPtr.Zero;}
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
    }
}
```

When True, such types will generate an XA4212 error, otherwise an
XA4212 warning will be generated.

This property is `True` by default.

## AndroidExplicitCrunch

This property is no longer supported.

## AndroidExtraAotOptions

A string property that allows
passing options to the Mono compiler during the `Aot`
task for projects that have either
[`$(AndroidEnableProfiledAot)`](#androidenableprofiledaot) or
[`$(AotAssemblies)`](#aotassemblies) set to `true`.
The string value of the property is added to the response file when
calling the Mono cross-compiler.

In general, this property should be left blank, but in certain
special scenarios it might provide useful flexibility.

The `$(AndroidExtraAotOptions)` property is different from the related
[`$(AndroidAotAdditionalArguments)`](#androidaotadditionalarguments) property;
`$(AndroidAotAdditionalArguments)` places
comma-separated arguments into the `--aot` option of the Mono
compiler. `$(AndroidExtraAotOptions)` instead passes full standalone
space-separated options like `--verbose` or `--debug` to the
compiler.

<a name="AndroidFastDeploymentType"></a>

## AndroidFastDeploymentType

A `:` (colon)-separated list
of values to control what types can be deployed to the
[Fast Deployment directory](build-process.md#Fast_Deployment)
on the target device
when the [`$(EmbedAssembliesIntoApk)`](#embedassembliesintoapk) MSBuild
property is `False`. If a resource is fast deployed, it is *not*
embedded into the generated `.apk`, which can speed up deployment
times. (The more that is fast deployed, then the less frequently
the `.apk` needs to be rebuilt, and the install process can be
faster.) Valid values include:

- `Assemblies`: Deploy application assemblies.
- `Dexes`: Deploy `.dex` files, native libraries and typemaps.
  **The `Dexes` value can *only* be used on devices running
  Android 4.4 or later (API-19).**

The default value is `Assemblies`.

Support for Fast Deploying resources and assets via that system was
removed in commit [f0d565fe](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/commit/f0d565fe4833f16df31378c77bbb492ffd2904b9). This was becuase it required the use of
deprecated API's to work.

**Support for this feature was removed in .NET 9

**Experimental**.

## AndroidFragmentType

Specifies the default fully qualified type to be used for all `<fragment>` layout
elements when generating the layout bindings code. The default value is the standard
Android `Android.App.Fragment` type.

## AndroidGenerateJniMarshalMethods

A bool property that
enables generating of JNI marshal methods as part of the build
process. This greatly reduces the `System.Reflection` usage in the
binding helper code.

The default value is `False`.  If developers wish to use
the new JNI marshal methods feature, they can set

```xml
<AndroidGenerateJniMarshalMethods>True</AndroidGenerateJniMarshalMethods>
```

in their `.csproj`. Alternatively provide the property on the command
line via

```shell
-p:AndroidGenerateJniMarshalMethods=True
```

**Experimental**.  The default value is `False`.

## AndroidGenerateJniMarshalMethodsAdditionalArguments

A string property that can be used to add parameters to
the `jnimarshalmethod-gen.exe` invocation, and is useful for
debugging, so that options such as `-v`, `-d`, or `--keeptemp` can
be used.

Default value is empty string. It can be set in the `.csproj` file or
on the command line. For example:

```xml
<AndroidGenerateJniMarshalMethodsAdditionalArguments>-v -d --keeptemp</AndroidGenerateJniMarshalMethodsAdditionalArguments>
```

or:

```shell
-p:AndroidGenerateJniMarshalMethodsAdditionalArguments="-v -d --keeptemp"
```

## AndroidGenerateLayoutBindings

Enables generation of
[layout code-behind](../features/layout-code-behind/index.md)
if set to `true` or disables it completely if set to `false`.

The default value is `false`.

## AndroidGenerateResourceDesigner

The default value is `true`. When set to `false`, disables the generation of `Resource.designer.cs`.

## AndroidHttpClientHandlerType

Controls the default
`System.Net.Http.HttpMessageHandler` implementation which will be used by
the `System.Net.Http.HttpClient` default constructor. The value is an
assembly-qualified type name of an `HttpMessageHandler` subclass, suitable
for use with
[`System.Type.GetType(string)`](/dotnet/api/system.type.gettype#System_Type_GetType_System_String_).

In .NET 6 and newer, this property has effect only when used together
with [`$(UseNativeHttpHandler)=true`][feature-switches].
The most common values for this property are:

- `Xamarin.Android.Net.AndroidMessageHandler`: Use the Android Java APIs
  to perform HTTP requests. It is similar to the legacy
  `Xamarin.Android.Net.AndroidClientHandler` with several improvements.
  It supports HTTP 1.1 and TLS 1.2. It is the default HTTP message handler.

- `System.Net.Http.SocketsHttpHandler, System.Net.Http`: The default message
  handler in .NET. It supports HTTP/2, TLS 1.2, and it is the recommended
  HTTP message handler to use with [Grpc.Net.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Grpc.Net.Client).
  This value is equivalent to `$(UseNativeHttpHandler)=false`.

- Unset/the empty string, which is equivalent to
  `System.Net.Http.HttpClientHandler, System.Net.Http`

  Corresponds to the **Default** option in the Visual Studio
  property pages.

  The new project wizard selects this option for new projects when the
  **Minimum Android Version** is configured to **Android 4.4.87** or
  lower in Visual Studio or when **Target Platforms** is set to **Modern
  Development** or **Maximum Compatibility** in Visual Studio for Mac.

- `System.Net.Http.HttpClientHandler, System.Net.Http`: Use the managed
  `HttpMessageHandler`.

  Corresponds to the **Managed** option in the Visual Studio
  property pages.

> [!NOTE]
> In .NET 6, the type you specify must not be
> `Xamarin.Android.Net.AndroidClientHandler` or `System.Net.Http.HttpClientHandler`
> or inherit from either of these classes. If you are migrating from
> "classic" Xamarin.Android, use `AndroidMessageHandler` or derive your
> custom handler from it instead.

> [!NOTE]
> Support for the `$(AndroidHttpClientHandlerType)` property works by setting the
> [`XA_HTTP_CLIENT_HANDLER_TYPE` environment variable](/xamarin/android/deploy-test/environment).
> A `$XA_HTTP_CLIENT_HANDLER_TYPE` value found in a file
> with a Build action of
> [`@(AndroidEnvironment)`](build-items.md#androidenvironment)
> will take precedence.

## AndroidIncludeWrapSh

A boolean value that indicates whether the Android wrapper script
([`wrap.sh`](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/wrap-script))
should be packaged into the APK. The default value is `false`
since the wrapper script may significantly influence the way the
application starts up and works and the script should be included only
when necessary, for example when debugging or otherwise changing the
application startup/runtime behavior.

The script is added to the project using the
[`@(AndroidNativeLibrary)`](build-items.md#androidnativelibrary)
build action, because it is placed in the same directory as
architecture-specific native libraries, and must be named `wrap.sh`.

The easiest way to specify path to the `wrap.sh` script is to put it
in a directory named after the target architecture. This approach will
work if you have just one `wrap.sh` per architecture:

```xml
<AndroidNativeLibrary Include="path/to/arm64-v8a/wrap.sh" />
```

However, if your project needs more than one `wrap.sh` per
architecture, for different purposes, this approach won't work.
Instead, in such cases the name can be specified using the `Link`
metadata of the `AndroidNativeLibrary`:

```xml
<AndroidNativeLibrary Include="/path/to/my/arm64-wrap.sh">
  <Link>lib\arm64-v8a\wrap.sh</Link>
</AndroidNativeLibrary>
```

If the `Link` metadata is used, the path specified in its value must
be a valid native architecture-specific library path, relative to the
APK root directory. The format of the path is `lib\ARCH\wrap.sh` where
`ARCH` can be one of:

+ `arm64-v8a`
+ `armeabi-v7a`
+ `x86_64`
+ `x86`

## AndroidIncludeAssetPacksInPackage

This property controls if an Asset Packs build automatically are auto
included in the final `.aab` file. It will default to `true`.

In certain cases the user might want to release an interim release. In
these cases the user does not need to update the asset pack. Especially
if the contents of the asset pack have not changed. This property allows
the user to skip the asset packs if they are not required.

Added in .NET 9

## AndroidInstallJavaDependencies

The default value is `true` for command line builds. When set to `true`, enables
installation of the Java SDK when running the `<InstallAndroidDependencies/>` target.

Support for this property was added in .NET 9.

## AndroidJavadocVerbosity

Specifies how "verbose"
[C# XML Documentation Comments](/dotnet/csharp/codedoc)
should be when importing Javadoc documentation within binding projects.

Requires use of the
[`@(JavaSourceJar)`](build-items.md#javasourcejar)
build action.

The `$(AndroidJavadocVerbosity)` property is enum-like, with possible values of `full` or
`intellisense`:

  * `intellisense`: Only emit the XML comments:
    [`<exception/>`](/dotnet/csharp/codedoc#exception),
    [`<param/>`](/dotnet/csharp/codedoc#param),
    [`<returns/>`](/dotnet/csharp/codedoc#returns),
    [`<summary/>`](/dotnet/csharp/codedoc#summary).
  * `full`: Emit `intellisense` elements, as well as
    [`<remarks/>`](/dotnet/csharp/codedoc#remarks),
    [`<seealso/>`](/dotnet/csharp/codedoc#seealso),
    and anything else that's supportable.

The default value is `intellisense`.

## AndroidKeyStore

A boolean value that indicates whether
custom signing information should be used. The default value is
`False`, meaning that the default debug-signing key will be used
to sign packages.

## AndroidLaunchActivity

The Android activity to launch.

## AndroidLinkMode

Specifies which type of
[linking](/xamarin/android/deploy-test/linker) should be
performed on assemblies contained within the Android package. Only
used in Android Application projects. The default value is
*SdkOnly*. Valid values are:

- **None**: No linking will be attempted.

- **SdkOnly**: Linking will be performed on the base class
  libraries only, not user's assemblies.

- **Full**: Linking will be performed on base class libraries and
  user assemblies.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Using an `AndroidLinkMode` value of *Full* often
  > results in broken apps, particularly when Reflection is used. Avoid unless
  > you *really* know what you're doing.

```xml
<AndroidLinkMode>SdkOnly</AndroidLinkMode>
```

## AndroidLinkResources

When `true`, the build system will link out the Nested Types
of the Resource.Designer.cs `Resource` class in all assemblies. The
IL code that uses those types will be updated to use the values
directly rather than accessing fields.

Linking out the nested types can have a small impact on reducing the apk size,
and can also help with startup performance. Only "Release" builds are linked.

***Experimental***.  Only designed to work with code such as

```csharp
var view = FindViewById(Resources.Ids.foo);
```

Any other scenarios (such as reflection) will not be supported.

## AndroidLinkSkip

Specifies a semicolon-delimited (`;`)
list of assembly names, without file extensions, of assemblies that
should not be linked. Only used within Android Application
projects.

```xml
<AndroidLinkSkip>Assembly1;Assembly2</AndroidLinkSkip>
```

## AndroidLinkTool

An enum-style property with valid
values of `proguard` or `r8`. Indicates which code shrinker is
used for Java code. The default value is an empty string, or
`proguard` if `$(AndroidEnableProguard)` is `True`. See our documentation on
[D8 and R8][d8-r8].

[d8-r8]: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/blob/main/Documentation/guides/D8andR8.md

## AndroidLintEnabled

A bool property that allows the developer to
run the android `lint` tool as part of the packaging process.

When `$(AndroidLintEnabled)`=True, the following properties are used:

- [`$(AndroidLintEnabledIssues)`](#androidlintenabledissues):
- [`$(AndroidLintDisabledIssues)`](#androidlintdisabledissues):
- [`$(AndroidLintCheckIssues)`](#androidlintcheckissues):

The following build actions may also be used:

- [`@(AndroidLintConfig)`](build-items.md#androidlintconfig):

See [Lint Help](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/lint) for more details on
the android `lint` tooling.

## AndroidLintEnabledIssues

A string property that is a comma-separated list of lint issues to enable.

Only used when [`$(AndroidLintEnabled)`](#androidlintenabled)=True.

## AndroidLintDisabledIssues

A string property that is a comma-separated list of lint issues to disable.

Only used when [`$(AndroidLintEnabled)`](#androidlintenabled)=True.

## AndroidLintCheckIssues

A string property that is a comma-separated list of lint issues to check.

Only used when [`$(AndroidLintEnabled)`](#androidlintenabled)=True.

Note: only these issues will be checked.

## AndroidManagedSymbols

A boolean property that controls
whether sequence points are generated so that file name and line
number information can be extracted from `Release` stack traces.

## AndroidManifest

Specifies a filename to use as the template for the app's
[`AndroidManifest.xml`](/xamarin/android/platform/android-manifest).
During the build, any other necessary values will be merged into to
produce the actual `AndroidManifest.xml`.
The `$(AndroidManifest)` must contain the package name in the `/manifest/@package` attribute.

## AndroidManifestMerger

Specifies the implementation for
merging *AndroidManifest.xml* files. This is an enum-style property
where `legacy` selects the original C# implementation
and `manifestmerger.jar` selects Google's Java implementation.

The default value is currently `manifestmerger.jar`. If you want to
use the old version add the following to your csproj

```xml
<AndroidManifestMerger>legacy</AndroidManifestMerger>
```

Google's merger enables support for `xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"`
as described in the [Android documentation][manifest-merger].

[manifest-merger]: https://developer.android.com/studio/build/manifest-merge

## AndroidManifestMergerExtraArgs

A string property to provide arguments to the
[Android documentation][manifest-merger] tool.

If you want detailed output from the tool you can add the following to the
`.csproj`.

```xml
<AndroidManifestMergerExtraArgs>--log VERBOSE</AndroidManifestMergerExtraArgs>
```

## AndroidManifestType

An enum-style property with valid values of `Xamarin` or `GoogleV2`.
This controls which repository is used by the
[`InstallAndroidDependencies`](build-targets.md#installandroiddependencies)
target to determine which Android packages and package versions are
available and can be installed.

`Xamarin` is the **Approved List (Recommended)** repository within the
[Visual Studio SDK Manager](/xamarin/android/get-started/installation/android-sdk?tabs=windows#repository-selection).

`GoogleV2` is the **Full List (Unsupported)** repository within the
[Visual Studio SDK Manager](/xamarin/android/get-started/installation/android-sdk?tabs=windows#repository-selection).

If `$(AndroidManifestType)` is not set, then `Xamarin` is used.

## AndroidManifestPlaceholders

A semicolon-separated list of
key-value replacement pairs for *AndroidManifest.xml*, where each pair
has the format `key=value`.

For example, a property value of `assemblyName=$(AssemblyName)`
defines an `${assemblyName}` placeholder that can then appear in
*AndroidManifest.xml*:

```xml
<application android:label="${assemblyName}"
```

This provides a way to insert variables from the build process into
the *AndroidManifest.xml* file.

## AndroidMultiDexClassListExtraArgs

A string property
which allows developers to pass arguments to the
`com.android.multidex.MainDexListBuilder` when generating the
`multidex.keep` file.

One specific case is if you are getting the following error
during the `dx` compilation.

```text
com.android.dex.DexException: Too many classes in --main-dex-list, main dex capacity exceeded
```

If you are getting this error you can add the following to the
`.csproj`.

```xml
<DxExtraArguments>--force-jumbo </DxExtraArguments>
<AndroidMultiDexClassListExtraArgs>--disable-annotation-resolution-workaround</AndroidMultiDexClassListExtraArgs>
```

which will allow the `dx` step to succeed.

## AndroidPackageFormat

An enum-style property with valid
values of `apk` or `aab`. Indicates if you want to package
the Android application as an [APK file][apk] or [Android App
Bundle][bundle]. App Bundles are a new format for `Release` builds
that are intended for submission on Google Play. The default value is `apk`.

When `$(AndroidPackageFormat)` is set to `aab`, other MSBuild
properties are set, which are required for Android App Bundles:

- [`$(AndroidUseApkSigner)`](#androiduseapksigner) is `False`.
- [`$(AndroidCreatePackagePerAbi)`](#androidcreatepackageperabi) is `False`.

[apk]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_application_package
[bundle]: https://developer.android.com/platform/technology/app-bundle

This property will be deprecated for .net 6. Users should switch over to
the newer [`AndroidPackageFormats`](build-properties.md#androidpackageformats).

## AndroidPackageFormats

A semi-colon delimited property with valid values of `apk` and `aab`.
Indicates if you want to package the Android application as
an [APK file][apk] or [Android App Bundle][bundle]. App Bundles
are a new format for `Release` builds that are intended for
submission on Google Play.

When building a Release build you might want to generate both
and `aab` and an `apk` for distribution to various stores.

Setting `AndroidPackageFormats` to `aab;apk` will result in both
being generated. Setting `AndroidPackageFormats` to either `aab`
or `apk` will generate only one file.

The default value is `aab;apk` for `Release` builds only.
It is recommended that you continue to use just `apk` for debugging.

## AndroidPackageNamingPolicy

An enum-style property for
specifying the Java package names of generated Java source code.

The only supported value is
`LowercaseCrc64`.

## AndroidPrepareForBuildDependsOn

A semi-colon delimited property that can be used to extend the
Android build process. MSBuild targets added to this property
will execute early in the build for both Application and Library
project types. This property is empty by default.

Example:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <AndroidPrepareForBuildDependsOn>MyCustomTarget</AndroidPrepareForBuildDependsOn>
</PropertyGroup>

<Target Name="MyCustomTarget" >
  <Message Text="Running target: 'MyCustomTarget'" Importance="high"  />
</Target>
```

## AndroidProguardMappingFile

Specifies the `-printmapping` proguard rule for `r8`. This will
mean the `mapping.txt` file will be produced in the `$(OutputPath)`
folder. This file can then be used when uploading packages to the
Google Play Store.

By default this file is produced automatically when using `AndroidLinkTool=r8`
and will generate the following file `$(OutputPath)mapping.txt`.

If you do not want to generate this mapping file you can use the
[`AndroidCreateProguardMappingFile`](#androidcreateproguardmappingfile) property to stop creating it .
Add the following in your project

```xml
<AndroidCreateProguardMappingFile>False</AndroidCreateProguardMappingFile>
```

or use `-p:AndroidCreateProguardMappingFile=False` on the command line.

## AndroidD8IgnoreWarnings

Specifies `--map-diagnostics warning info` to be passed to `d8`. The
default value is `True`, but can be set to `False` to enforce more
strict behavior. See the [D8 and R8 source code][r8-source] for details.

Added in .NET 8.

## AndroidR8IgnoreWarnings

Specifies
the `-ignorewarnings` proguard rule for `r8`. This allows `r8`
to continue with dex compilation even if certain warnings are
encountered. The default value is `True`, but can be set to `False` to
enforce more strict behavior. See the [ProGuard manual](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage) for details.

Starting in .NET 8, specifies `--map-diagnostics warning info`. See
the [D8 and R8 source code][r8-source] for details.

[r8-source]: https://r8.googlesource.com/r8/+/refs/tags/3.3.75/src/main/java/com/android/tools/r8/BaseCompilerCommandParser.java#246

## AndroidR8JarPath

The path to `r8.jar` for use with the
r8 dex-compiler and shrinker. The default value is a path into the
.NET for Android workload installation. For further information see our
documentation on [D8 and R8][d8-r8].

## AndroidResgenExtraArgs

Specifies
command-line options to pass to the **aapt** command when
processing Android assets and resources.

## AndroidResgenFile

Specifies the name of the Resource
file to generate. The default template sets this to
`Resource.designer.cs`.

## AndroidResourceDesignerClassModifier

Specifies the class modifier for the intermediate `Resource` class which is
generated. Valid values are `public` and `internal`.

By default this will be `public`.

Added in .NET 9.

## AndroidSdkBuildToolsVersion

The Android SDK
build-tools package provides the **aapt** and **zipalign** tools,
among others. Multiple different versions of the build-tools package
may be installed simultaneously. The build-tools package chosen for
packaging is done by checking for and using a
"preferred" build-tools version if it is present; if
the "preferred" version is *not* present, then the
highest versioned installed build-tools package is used.

The `$(AndroidSdkBuildToolsVersion)` MSBuild property contains
the preferred build-tools version. The .NET for Android build system
provides a default value in `Xamarin.Android.Common.targets`, and
the default value may be overridden within your project file to
choose an alternate build-tools version, if (for example) the
latest aapt is crashing out while a previous aapt version is known
to work.

## AndroidSigningKeyAlias

Specifies the alias for the key
in the keystore. This is the **keytool -alias** value used when
creating the keystore.

## AndroidSigningKeyPass

Specifies the password of the key within the keystore file. This is
the value entered when `keytool` asks **Enter key password for
$(AndroidSigningKeyAlias)**.

This property also supports `env:` and `file:` prefixes that can be
used to specify an environment variable or file that contains the password.
These options provide a way to prevent the password from appearing in
build logs.

For example, to use an environment variable named
*AndroidSigningPassword*:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <AndroidSigningKeyPass>env:AndroidSigningPassword</AndroidSigningKeyPass>
</PropertyGroup>
```

To use a file located at `C:\Users\user1\AndroidSigningPassword.txt`:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <AndroidSigningKeyPass>file:C:\Users\user1\AndroidSigningPassword.txt</AndroidSigningKeyPass>
</PropertyGroup>
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `env:` prefix is not supported when [`$(AndroidPackageFormat)`](#androidpackageformat)
> is set to `aab`.

## AndroidSigningKeyStore

Specifies the filename of the
keystore file created by `keytool`. This corresponds to the value
provided to the **keytool -keystore** option.

## AndroidSigningStorePass

Specifies the password to
[`$(AndroidSigningKeyStore)`](#androidsigningkeystore).
This is the value provided to
`keytool` when creating the keystore file and asked **Enter
keystore password:**.

This property also supports `env:` and `file:` prefixes that can be used to
specify an environment variable or file that contains the password. These
options provide a way to prevent the password from appearing in
build logs.

For example, to use an environment variable named
*AndroidSigningPassword*:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <AndroidSigningStorePass>env:AndroidSigningPassword</AndroidSigningStorePass>
</PropertyGroup>
```

To use a file located at `C:\Users\user1\AndroidSigningPassword.txt`:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <AndroidSigningStorePass>file:C:\Users\user1\AndroidSigningPassword.txt</AndroidSigningStorePass>
</PropertyGroup>
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `env:` prefix is not supported when [`$(AndroidPackageFormat)`](#androidpackageformat)
> is set to `aab`.

## AndroidSigningPlatformKey

Specifies the key file to use to sign the apk.
This is only used when building `system` applications.

## AndroidSigningPlatformCert

Specifies the certificate file to use to sign the apk.
This is only used when building `system` applications.

## AndroidStripILAfterAOT

A bool property that specifies whether or not the *method bodies* of AOT compiled methods will be removed.

The default value is `false`, and the method bodies of AOT compiled methods will *not* be removed.

When set to `true`, [`$(AndroidEnableProfiledAot)`](#androidenableprofiledaot) is set to `false` by default.
This means that in Release configuration builds -- in which
[`$(RunAOTCompilation)`](#runaotcompilation) is `true` by default -- AOT is enabled for *everything*.
This can result in increased app sizes. This behavior can be overridden by explicitly setting
`$(AndroidEnableProfiledAot)` to `true` within your project file.

Support for this property was added in .NET 8.

## AndroidSupportedAbis

A string property that contains a
semicolon (`;`)-delimited list of ABIs which should be included
into the `.apk`.

Supported values include:

- `armeabi-v7a`
- `x86`
- `arm64-v8a`
- `x86_64`

## AndroidTlsProvider

This property is obsolete and should not be used.

## AndroidUseApkSigner

A bool property that allows the developer to
use the `apksigner` tool rather than `jarsigner`.

## AndroidUseDefaultAotProfile

A bool property that allows
the developer to suppress usage of the default AOT profiles.

To suppress the default AOT profiles, set the property to `false`.

## AndroidUseDesignerAssembly

A bool property which controls if the build system will generate an
`_Microsoft.Android.Resource.Designer.dll` as apposed to a `Resource.Designer.cs` file. The benefits of this are smaller applications and
faster startup time.

The default value is `true` in .NET 8.

As a Nuget Author it is recommended that you ship three versions of
the assembly if you want to maintain backward compatibility.
One for MonoAndroid, one for net6.0-android and
one for net8.0-android. You can do this by using [Xamarin.Legacy.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.Legacy.Sdk). This is only required if your Nuget Library
project makes use of `AndroidResource` items in the project or via a dependency.

```xml
<TargetFrameworks>monoandroid90;net6.0-android;net8.0-android</TargetFrameworks>
```

Alternatively turn this setting off until such time as both Classic and
net7.0-android have been deprecated.

.NET 8 Projects which choose to turn this setting off will not be able to
consume references which do use it. If you try to use an assembly
which does have this feature enabled in a project that does not, you will
get a `XA1034` build error.

Added in .NET 8.

## AndroidUseInterpreter

A boolean property that causes the `.apk` to contain the mono
*interpreter*, and not the normal JIT.

***Experimental***.

## AndroidUseLegacyVersionCode

A boolean property that allows
the developer to revert the versionCode calculation back to its old pre
Xamarin.Android 8.2 behavior. This should ONLY be used for developers
with existing applications in the Google Play Store. It is highly recommended
that the new [`$(AndroidVersionCodePattern)`](#androidversioncodepattern)
property is used.

## AndroidUseManagedDesignTimeResourceGenerator

A boolean property that
will switch over the design time builds to use the managed resource parser rather
than `aapt`.

## AndroidUseNegotiateAuthentication

A boolean property that enables support for NTLMv2/Negotiate authentication in
`AndroidMessageHandler`.  The default value is False.

Added in .NET 7.

## AndroidUseSharedRuntime

This property is obsolete and should not be used.

## AndroidVersionCode

An MSBuild property that can be used as an alternative to
`/manifest/@android:versionCode` in the [`AndroidManifest.xml`](/xamarin/android/platform/android-manifest)
file. To opt into this feature you must also enable
`<GenerateApplicationManifest>true</GenerateApplicationManifest>`.
This will be the default going forward in .NET 6.

This property is ignored if
[`$(AndroidCreatePackagePerAbi)`](#androidcreatepackageperabi) and
[`$(AndroidVersionCodePattern)`](#androidversioncodepattern) are used.

`@android:versionCode` is an integer value that must be incremented
for each Google Play release. See the [Android documentation][manifest-element]
for further details about the requirements for
`/manifest/@android:versionCode`.

## AndroidVersionCodePattern

A string property that allows
the developer to customize the `versionCode` in the manifest.
See [Creating the Version Code for the APK](/xamarin/android/deploy-test/building-apps/abi-specific-apks#creating-the-version-code-for-the-apk)
for information on deciding a `versionCode`.

Some examples, if `abi` is `armeabi` and `versionCode` in the manifest
is `123`, `{abi}{versionCode}`
will produce a versionCode of `1123` when `$(AndroidCreatePackagePerAbi)`
is True, otherwise will produce a value of 123.
If `abi` is `x86_64` and `versionCode` in the manifest
is `44`. This will produce `544` when `$(AndroidCreatePackagePerAbi)`
is True, otherwise will produce a value of `44`.

If we include a left padding format string
`{abi}{versionCode:0000}`,
it would produce `50044` because we are left padding the `versionCode`
with `0`. Alternatively, you can use the decimal padding such as
`{abi}{versionCode:D4}`
which does the same as the previous example.

Only '0' and 'Dx' padding format strings are supported since the value
MUST be an integer.

Pre-defined key items

- **abi**  &ndash; Inserts the targeted abi for the app
  - 2 &ndash; `armeabi-v7a`
  - 3 &ndash; `x86`
  - 4 &ndash; `arm64-v8a`
  - 5 &ndash; `x86_64`

- **minSDK**  &ndash; Inserts the minimum supported Sdk
  value from the `AndroidManifest.xml` or `11` if none is
  defined.

- **versionCode** &ndash; Uses the version code directly from
  `Properties\AndroidManifest.xml`.

You can define custom items using the `$(AndroidVersionCodeProperties)`
property (defined next).

By default the value will be set to `{abi}{versionCode:D6}`. If a developer
wants to keep the old behavior you can override the default by setting
the `$(AndroidUseLegacyVersionCode)` property to `true`

## AndroidVersionCodeProperties

A string property that
allows the developer to define custom items to use with the
[`$(AndroidVersionCodePattern)`](#androidversioncodepattern).
They are in the form of a `key=value`
pair. All items in the `value` should be integer values. For
example: `screen=23;target=$(_AndroidApiLevel)`. As you can see
you can make use of existing or custom MSBuild properties in the
string.

## ApplicationId

An MSBuild property that can be used as an alternative to
`/manifest/@package` in the [`AndroidManifest.xml`](/xamarin/android/platform/android-manifest)
file. To opt into this feature you must also enable
`<GenerateApplicationManifest>true</GenerateApplicationManifest>`.
This will be the default going forward in .NET 6.

See the [Android documentation][manifest-element] for further details
about the requirements for `/manifest/@package`.

[manifest-element]: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element

## ApplicationTitle

An MSBuild property that can be used as an alternative to
`/manifest/application/@android:label` in the [`AndroidManifest.xml`](/xamarin/android/platform/android-manifest)
file. To opt into this feature you must also enable
`<GenerateApplicationManifest>true</GenerateApplicationManifest>`.
This will be the default going forward in .NET 6.

See the [Android documentation][application-element] for further details
about the requirements for `/manifest/application/@android:label`.

[application-element]: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element

## ApplicationVersion

An MSBuild property that can be used as an alternative to
`/manifest/@android:versionName` in the [`AndroidManifest.xml`](/xamarin/android/platform/android-manifest)
file. To opt into this feature you must also enable
`<GenerateApplicationManifest>true</GenerateApplicationManifest>`.
This will be the default going forward in .NET 6.

See the [Android documentation][manifest-element] for further details
about the requirements for `/manifest/@android:versionName`.

## AotAssemblies

A boolean property that determines whether or not assemblies will be
Ahead-of-Time compiled into native code and included in applications.
This property is `False` by default.

Deprecated in .NET 7. Migrate to the new
[`$(RunAOTCompilation)`](#runaotcompilation) MSBuild property instead,
as support for `$(AotAssemblies)` will be removed in a future release.

## AProfUtilExtraOptions

Extra options to pass to `aprofutil`.

## BeforeBuildAndroidAssetPacks

MSBuild Targets listed in this
property will run directly before the `AssetPack` items are built.

Added in .NET 9

## BeforeGenerateAndroidManifest

MSBuild Targets listed in this
property will run directly before `_GenerateJavaStubs`.

## Configuration

Specifies the build configuration to use,
such as "Debug" or "Release". The
Configuration property is used to determine default values for
other properties which determine target behavior. Additional
configurations may be created within your IDE.

*By default*, the `Debug` configuration will result in the
[`Install`](build-targets.md#install)
and
[`SignAndroidPackage`](build-targets.md#signandroidpackage)
targets creating a smaller Android package which requires the presence of other
files and packages to operate.

The default `Release` configuration will result in the
[`Install`](build-targets.md#install)
and
[`SignAndroidPackage`](build-targets.md#signandroidpackage)
targets creating an Android package which is *stand-alone*, and may be used
without installing any other packages or files.

## DebugSymbols

A boolean value that determines whether
the Android package is *debuggable*, in combination with the
[`$(DebugType)`](#debugtype) property.
A debuggable package contains debug symbols, sets the
[`//application/@android:debuggable` attribute](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element#debug)
to `true`, and automatically adds the
[`INTERNET`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#INTERNET)
permission so that a debugger can attach to the process. An application is
debuggable if `DebugSymbols` is `True` *and* `DebugType` is either the empty
string or `Full`.

## DebugType

Specifies the
[type of debug symbols](/visualstudio/msbuild/csc-task)
to generate as part of the build, which also impacts whether the
Application is debuggable. Possible values include:

- **Full**: Full symbols are generated. If the
  [`DebugSymbols`](#debugsymbols)
  MSBuild property is also `True`, then the Application package is
  debuggable.

- **PdbOnly**: "PDB" symbols are generated. The
  Application package is not debuggable.

If `DebugType` is not set or is the empty string, then the
`DebugSymbols` property controls whether or not the Application is
debuggable.

## EmbedAssembliesIntoApk

A boolean property that
determines whether or not the app's assemblies should be embedded
into the Application package.

This property should be `True` for Release builds and `False` for
Debug builds. It *may* need to be `True` in Debug builds if Fast
Deployment doesn't support the target device.

When this property is `False`, then the
[`$(AndroidFastDeploymentType)`](#androidfastdeploymenttype)
MSBuild property also controls what
will be embedded into the `.apk`, which can impact deployment and
rebuild times.

## EnableLLVM

A boolean property that determines whether
or not LLVM will be used when Ahead-of-Time compiling assemblies
into native code.

The Android NDK must be installed to build a project that has this
property enabled.

This property is `False` by default.

This property is ignored unless the
[`$(AotAssemblies)`](#aotassemblies) MSBuild property is `True`.

## EnableProguard

A boolean property that determines
whether or not [proguard](https://developer.android.com/tools/help/proguard.html)
is run as part of the packaging process to link Java code.

This property is `False` by default.

When `True`,
[@(ProguardConfiguration)](build-items.md#proguardconfiguration)
files will be used
to control `proguard` execution.

## GenerateApplicationManifest

Enables or disables the following MSBuild properties that emit values
in the final [`AndroidManifest.xml`](/xamarin/android/platform/android-manifest) file:

- [`$(AndroidVersionCode)`](#androidversioncode)
- [`$(ApplicationId)`](#applicationid)
- [`$(ApplicationTitle)`](#applicationtitle)
- [`$(ApplicationVersion)`](#applicationversion)

The default value `$(GenerateApplicationManifest)` is `true`.

## JavaMaximumHeapSize

Specifies the value of the **java**
`-Xmx` parameter value to use when building the `.dex` file as part
of the packaging process. If not specified, then the `-Xmx` option
supplies **java** with a value of `1G`. This was found to be commonly
required on Windows in comparison to other platforms.

Specifying this property is necessary if the `_CompileDex` target throws a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError`.

Customize the value by changing:

```xml
<JavaMaximumHeapSize>1G</JavaMaximumHeapSize>
```

## JavaOptions

Specifies command-line options
to pass to **java** when building the `.dex` file.

## JarsignerTimestampAuthorityCertificateAlias

This
property allows you to specify an alias in the keystore
for a timestamp authority.
See the Java [Signature Timestamp Support](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/time-of-signing.html) documentation for more details.

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <JarsignerTimestampAuthorityCertificateAlias>Alias</JarsignerTimestampAuthorityCertificateAlias>
</PropertyGroup>
```

## JarsignerTimestampAuthorityUrl

This property
allows you to specify a URL to a timestamp authority
service. This can be used to make sure your `.apk` signature
includes a timestamp.
See the Java [Signature Timestamp Support](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/time-of-signing.html) documentation for more details.

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <JarsignerTimestampAuthorityUrl>http://example.tsa.url</JarsignerTimestampAuthorityUrl>
</PropertyGroup>
```

## LinkerDumpDependencies

A bool property that enables
generating of linker dependencies file. This file can be used as
input for
[illinkanalyzer](https://github.com/mono/linker/blob/master/src/analyzer/README.md)
tool.

The dependencies file named `linker-dependencies.xml.gz` is written
to the project directory. On .NET5/6 it is written next to the linked
assemblies in `obj/<Configuration>/android<ABI>/linked` directory.

The default value is False.

## MandroidI18n

This MSBuild property is obsolete and is no longer supported.

## MonoAndroidResourcePrefix

Specifies a *path prefix*
that is removed from the start of filenames with a Build action of
`AndroidResource`. This is to allow changing where resources are
located.

The default value is `Resources`. Change this to `res` for the
Java project structure.

## MonoSymbolArchive

A boolean property that controls
whether `.mSYM` artifacts are created for later use with
`mono-symbolicate`, to extract &ldquo;real&rdquo; filename and line
number information from Release stack traces.

This is True by default for &ldquo;Release&rdquo; apps which have
debugging symbols enabled:
[`$(EmbedAssembliesIntoApk)`](#embedassembliesintoapk) is True,
[`$(DebugSymbols)`](#debugsymbols)
 is True, and
[`$(Optimize)`](/visualstudio/msbuild/common-msbuild-project-properties)
is True.

## RunAOTCompilation

A boolean property that determines whether or not assemblies will be
Ahead-of-Time compiled into native code and included in applications.
This property is `False` by default for `Debug` builds and `True` by
default for `Release` builds.

This MSBuild property replaces the
[`$(AotAssemblies)`](#aotassemblies) MSBuild property from
Xamarin.Android. This is the same property used for [Blazor WASM][blazor].

[blazor]: /aspnet/core/blazor/host-and-deploy/webassembly/#ahead-of-time-aot-compilation
