# Development tips and native debugging

Tips and tricks while developing .NET for Android.

# Run MSBuild-Based On-Device Unit Tests

The [`tests/MSBuildDeviceIntegration`](tests/MSBuildDeviceIntegration)
directory contains NUnit-based unit tests which need to run against an attached
Android device (hardware or emulator).  There are *lots* of tests in here, and
running them all can take a significant amount of time.

If you need to run only *one* `[Test]` method, you can use
[`dotnet test --filter`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/testing/selective-unit-tests?pivots=mstest):

    ./dotnet-local.sh test bin/TestDebug/MSBuildDeviceIntegration/net6.0/MSBuildDeviceIntegration.dll --filter "Name~TypeAndMemberRemapping"

# Update directory

When a .NET for Android app launches on an Android device, and the app was
built in the `Debug` configuration, it will create an "update" directory
during process startup, printing the created directory to `adb logcat`:

     W/monodroid( 2796): Creating public update directory: `/data/data/Mono.Android_Tests/files/.__override__`

When the app needs to resolve native libraries and assemblies, it will look
for those files within the update directory *first*. This includes the Mono
runtime library and BCL assemblies.

Note that the update directory is *per-app*. The above mentioned `Mono.Android_Tests`
directory is created when running the
[`Mono.Android-Tests.csproj`](../../tests/Mono.Android-Tests/Mono.Android-Tests.csproj)
unit tests.

The update directory is not used in `Release` configuration builds.
(Note: `Release` configuration for the *app itself*, not for xamarin-android.)

Keep in mind that only the app that owns the update directory has permission to
write to it, so on a normal non-rooted device or emulator, you'll need to use
`adb shell run-as` to add new files.  For example, if you're working on a
mono/x86 bug and need to quickly update the app on the device to test
`libmonosgen-2.0.so` changes:

    $ make -C src/mono-runtimes/obj/Debug/x86 && \
      adb push src/mono-runtimes/obj/Debug/x86/mono/mini/.libs/libmonosgen-2.0.so \
        /data/local/tmp/ && \
      adb shell run-as Mono.Android_Tests cp /data/local/tmp/libmonosgen-2.0.so \
        /data/data/Mono.Android_Tests/files/.__override__/

Alternatively, if you're working on an `mscorlib.dll` bug:

    $ make -C external/mono/mcs/class/corlib PROFILE=monodroid && \
      adb push external/mono/mcs/class/lib/monodroid/mscorlib.dll \
        /data/local/tmp/ && \
      adb shell run-as Mono.Android_Tests cp /data/local/tmp/mscorlib.dll \
        /data/data/Mono.Android_Tests/files/.__override__/

On some devices, the `run-as` command might not have permission to read the
files in `/data/local/tmp/`.  In that case, you can use a `cat` command that
*pipes to* the `run-as` command:

    $ make -C external/mono/mcs/class/corlib PROFILE=monodroid && \
      adb push external/mono/mcs/class/lib/monodroid/mscorlib.dll \
        /data/local/tmp/ && \
      adb shell "cat /data/local/tmp/mscorlib.dll | \
        run-as Mono.Android_Tests sh -c \
        'cat > /data/data/Mono.Android_Tests/files/.__override__/mscorlib.dll'"

# Attaching LLDB using mono/lldb-binaries on macOS

Download the precompiled `lldb` and `lldb-server` binaries from
<https://github.com/mono/lldb-binaries/releases>, and follow the instructions
within [README.md][lldb-readme].

If you need to run the app with managed debugger attached, first edit the
`xa-lldb` script to comment out the following line:

    shell "am start -S -n $PKG/$CLASS -a android.intent.action.MAIN -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"

Then start the app from Visual Studio with managed debugging as usual.  After
that, run the `xa-lldb` script as described in README.md.

[lldb-readme]: https://github.com/mono/lldb-binaries/blob/master/README.md

## Adding debug symbols for `libmonosgen-2.0.so`

First, you'll need to get a version of `libmonosgen-2.0.so` that includes debug
symbols.  You can either use a custom local build or download the debug version
of `libmonosgen-2.0.so` for a published .NET for Android version:

 1. Go to <https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/tags> and click on the
    .NET for Android version you are debugging.

 2. Find the **OSS core** section at the bottom of the release information and
    click the link to the open-source build.

 3. Navigate to **Azure Artifacts** in the left sidebar and download the
    `xamarin-android/xamarin-android/bin/Release/bundle*.7z` file.  For the
    `d16-2` branch and earlier, the file extension will be `.zip` instead of
    `.7z`.

 4. Extract the `libmonosgen-2.0.d.so` files from the bundle.  For example, if
    you have `brew` installed, run:

        $ brew install p7zip
        $ 7z x -r bundle*.7z libmonosgen-2.0.d.so

    On Windows, Visual Studio includes the `7z.exe` executable when the **Mobile
    development with .NET** workload is installed, so you can use that:

        "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\Extensions\Xamarin.VisualStudio\7-Zip\7z.exe" x -r bundle*.7z libmonosgen-2.0.d.so

    For `d16-2` and earlier, use `unzip` instead:

        $ unzip bundle*.zip '**libmonosgen-2.0.d.so'

    (On Windows, the Git Bash command prompt includes the `unzip` command, so
    that's one way to complete this step.)

Next, there are a few options to get LLDB to see the debug symbols.

### Option A: Add the library with symbols as an `@(AndroidNativeLibrary)`

This option is convenient because it doesn't require any `adb` commands.  On the
other hand, it requires rebuilding and redeploying the app to test each version
of `libmonosgen-2.0.so`, so it's not ideal if you need to test several different
versions of `libmonosgen-2.0.so`.

 1. Ensure that **Android Options > Use Shared Runtime** is enabled.

 2. Add the appropriate architecture of `libmonosgen-2.0.d.so` to the
    corresponding `lib` subdirectory of the app project as described in the
    [Using Native Libraries][using-native-libraries] documentation.  For
    example, if debugging an arm64-v8a app, add the arm64-v8a version of
    `libmonosgen-2.0.d.so` to the project in `lib/arm64-v8a/`.

 3. Rename the file to `libmonosgen-2.0.so`.

    ![libmonosgen-2.0.so added to the lib/arm64-v8a directory of the
      .NET for Android app project in the Visual Studio Solution
      Explorer](../images/lib-arm64-v8a-libmonosgen.png)

 4. Set the **Build Action** of the file to **AndroidNativeLibrary**.

    ![Build Action for libmonosgen-2.0.so set to AndroidNativeLibrary in the
      Visual Studio Properties
      window](../images/build-action-android-native-library.png)

 5. Build, deploy, and run the app.  Then attach LLDB.

 6. If desired, follow the `image lookup` and `settings set --
    target.source-map` steps from the [Debugging Mono binaries with LLDB
    guide][lldb-source-map] to allow stepping through the Mono runtime source
    files.

[using-native-libraries]: https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/android/platform/native-libraries
[lldb-source-map]: https://www.mono-project.com/docs/debug+profile/debug/lldb-source-map/

### Option B: Upload the library with symbols to the update directory

This option is useful for testing a number of different `libmonosgen-2.0.so`
versions quickly without rebuilding or redeploying the app, but it requires a
little care to complete the `adb` steps correctly on the command line.

 1. Push the appropriate architecture of `libmonosgen-2.0.d.so` into the
    application's update directory and rename it to `libmonosgen-2.0.so`:

        $ adb push libmonosgen-2.0.d.so \
            /data/local/tmp/libmonosgen-2.0.so && \
          adb shell run-as Mono.Android_Tests cp /data/local/tmp/libmonosgen-2.0.so \
            /data/data/Mono.Android_Tests/files/.__override__/

 2. Ensure all users have execute permissions on the application's data
    directory:

        $ adb shell run-as Mono.Android_Tests \
            chmod a+x /data/data/Mono.Android_Tests/

    This will allow LLDB to re-download `libmonosgen-2.0.so` and load the
    symbols from it.

 3. Run the app and attach LLDB.

### Option C: Manually load the library with symbols

This option allows testing an existing debuggable APK without pushing anything
new to the device.  The other options are usually more convenient, but loading
the symbols by hand might be useful in some cases.

 1. After attaching LLDB to the app, add the appropriate architecture of
    `libmonosgen-2.0.d.so` into LLDB with a command like:

        (lldb) image add ~/Downloads/lib/xamarin.android/xbuild/Xamarin/Android/lib/arm64-v8a/libmonosgen-2.0.d.so

 2. Find the current in-memory address of the `.text` section of
    `libmonosgen-2.0`.  For example, for a 64-bit app that's using the shared
    runtime, run the following command:

        (lldb) image dump sections libmonosgen-64bit-2.0.so

    Look for the row of the table that shows "code" as the "Type":

        SectID     Type             Load Address                             Perm File Off.  File Size  Flags      Section Name
        ---------- ---------------- ---------------------------------------  ---- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------------------------
        0x0000000a code             [0x00000071106c4e80-0x0000007110932674)  r-x  0x0002ee80 0x0026d7f4 0x00000006 libmonosgen-64bit-2.0.so..text

 3. Load the `.text` section from `libmonosgen-2.0.d.so` at the in-memory
    starting memory address of the `.text` section:

        (lldb) image load -f libmonosgen-2.0.d.so .text 0x00000071106c4e80

# Attaching GDB using Visual Studio on Windows

Visual Studio can attach GDB to .NET for Android for native debugging.  The
integration includes the usual features like the graphical thread and call stack
windows and the ability to set breakpoints using the source code editor.

 1. In the Visual Studio Installer, under the **Individual components** tab,
    ensure that **Development activities > C++ Android development tools** is
    installed.

 2. Install the Android NDK if you don't already have it.  For example, use
    **Tools > Android > Android SDK Manager** to install it.

 3. Set **Tools > Options > Cross Platform > C++ > Android > Android NDK** to
    the Android NDK path.  For example:

        C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk\ndk-bundle

 4. Quit and relaunch Visual Studio.

 5. Use **File > Open > Project/Solution** to open the signed debuggable APK for
    the application.

 6. Set the **Build > Configuration Manager > Active solution platform** to the
    application ABI.  If debugging an arm64-v8a application, explicitly add a
    platform named `ARM64` and set it as the active platform.

 7. If you need symbols for `libmonosgen-2.0`, copy the library file with
    symbols to a convenient local location, making sure the file name matches
    the name on device (for example, `libmonosgen-64bit-2.0.so` if using the
    64-bit shared runtime), and add the local location of the library to
    **Project > Properties > Additional Symbol Search Paths**.

 8. Start the app, for example by launching it with or without managed debugging
    from Visual Studio, or by tapping the app on the device.

 9. Select **Debug > Attach to Android process** and wait for the connection to
    complete.

10. If needed, you can use **Debug > Windows > Immediate** to interact with the
    GDB command line.  Prefix GDB commands with `-exec` to get the expected
    behavior.  For example to view the stack backtrace:

        -exec backtrace

11. You can set GDB to continue through the various native signals that Mono
    uses for its normal internal operations by running the following command in
    the **Immediate** window:

        -exec handle SIGXCPU SIG33 SIG35 SIGPWR SIGTTIN SIGTTOU SIGSYS nostop noprint

# Attaching LLDB using Android Studio on Windows or macOS

The LLDB integration in Android Studio is quite similar to the GDB integration
in Visual Studio.  This is a useful option if you are debugging on Windows and
are more familiar with LLDB than GDB or if you already have Android Studio
installed and don't currently have the Android NDK installed.

 1. Install [Android Studio][android-studio].  If you already have an Android
    SDK installation for .NET for Android, you can click **Cancel** on the **Android
    Studio Setup Wizard** when you launch Android Studio.

 2. Open the signed debuggable APK for the application in Android Studio via
    **Profile or debug APK** on the start window or the **File > Profile or
    Debug APK** menu item.

    ![Profile or debug in the Android Studio start
      window](../images/android-studio-start-window.png)

 3. If you skipped the **Android Studio Setup Wizard**, navigate to **File >
    Project Structure > Modules > Mono.Android_Tests-Signed > Dependencies**,
    click **New > Android SDK** next to the **Module SDK**.

    ![New SDK in the Android Studio Project Structure Modules Dependencies
      window](../images/android-studio-modules-dependencies.png)

    Select the Android SDK folder you're using with .NET for Android, and then
    under **Build target**, pick the appropriate Android API to match the APK.

    ![Create New Android SDK window in Android
      Studio](../images/android-studio-create-new-android-sdk.png)

 4. Wait for the **Indexing** status message at the bottom of the Android Studio
    window to disappear.

 5. Start the app, for example by launching it with or without managed debugging
    from Visual Studio, or by tapping the app on the device.

 6. In Android Studio, select **Run > Attach Debugger to Android Process**, or
    click the corresponding toolbar icon.

    ![Attach Debugger to Android Process in Android Studio Run
      menu](../images/android-studio-attach-debugger.png)

 7. Set the **Debugger** to **Native**, select the running app, and click
    **OK**.

    If the `adb` connection is slow, the first connection to the app will take a
    while to download all the system libraries.  The connection might time out
    if this takes too long, but the next connection attempt will have fewer
    libraries left to download and will likely succeed.

 8. You can set LLDB to continue through the various native signals that Mono
    uses for its normal internal operations by opening **View > Tool Windows >
    Debug**, selecting the **Android Native Debugger** tab, navigating to the
    inner **Debugger \[tab\] > LLDB \[tab\]** command prompt, and running the
    following `process handle` command:

        (lldb) process handle -p true -n true -s false SIGXCPU SIG33 SIG35 SIGPWR SIGTTIN SIGTTOU SIGSYS

    ![LLDB process handle command in Android Studio LLDB command
      prompt](../images/android-studio-lldb-no-stop-signals.png)

# Attaching GDB on the command line on Windows or macOS

If the automated methods to attach LLDB or GDB are hitting errors or getting
stuck, you can try to attach GDB from the command line as a fallback.  These
steps rely on having the Android NDK installed.

 1. Push the appropriate architecture of `gdbserver` to the device for the app
    you are debugging.  For example, if debugging an arm64-v8a app:

        $ adb push ~/Library/Developer/Xamarin/android-sdk-macosx/ndk-bundle/prebuilt/android-arm64/gdbserver/gdbserver \
            /data/local/tmp/ && \
          adb shell run-as Mono.Android_Tests cp /data/local/tmp/gdbserver ./ && \
          adb shell run-as Mono.Android_Tests chmod +x ./gdbserver

 2. Ensure all users have execute permissions on the application's data
    directory:

        $ adb shell run-as Mono.Android_Tests \
            chmod a+x /data/data/Mono.Android_Tests/

 3. Start the app, for example by launching it with or without managed debugging
    from Visual Studio, or by tapping the app on the device.

 4. Find the process ID of the running app, for example by using `adb shell ps`:

        $ adb shell ps | grep -F 'Mono.Android_Tests'

    Example output:

        u0_a247   15087 336   780568 69200 SyS_epoll_ 00000000 S Mono.Android_Tests

 5. Start `gdbserver`, attaching it to the running app process:

        $ adb shell run-as Mono.Android_Tests ./gdbserver \
            +debug_socket --attach 15087

 6. In another console window, use `adb` to forward the `debug_socket` UNIX
    domain socket to a TCP port on the local host:

        $ adb forward tcp:50999 localfilesystem:/data/data/Mono.Android_Tests/debug_socket

 7. Pull the appropriate `app_process*` file for the application to a local
    location.  For example, if debugging an arm64-v8a app:

        $ adb pull /system/bin/app_process64 /tmp/gdb-symbols/

 8. If you need symbols for `libmonosgen-2.0`, copy the library file with
    symbols to the same local location, making sure the file name matches the
    name on device (for example, `libmonosgen-64bit-2.0.so` if using the 64-bit
    shared runtime).

 9. Run `gdb`:

        $ ~/Library/Developer/Xamarin/android-sdk-macosx/ndk-bundle/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/bin/gdb

10. Run the following commands in GDB to set up the debugger and attach it to
    the app:

        (gdb) file /tmp/gdb-symbols/app_process64
        (gdb) set sysroot /tmp/gdb-symbols
        (gdb) set solib-search-path /tmp/gdb-symbols
        (gdb) target remote :50999

# .NET 6 Tips

## Finding Mono runtime packs

The Mono "runtime packs" for Android are:

* https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NETCore.App.Runtime.android-arm/
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NETCore.App.Runtime.android-arm64/
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NETCore.App.Runtime.android-x86/
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NETCore.App.Runtime.android-x64/

`main` builds of the Mono runtime packs are on the following NuGet
feed, such as this `nuget.config`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <add key="dotnet6" value="https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_packaging/dotnet6/nuget/v3/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```

You can view these packages on Azure DevOps here:

* https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_packaging?_a=feed&feed=dotnet6

You can search for a given pack such as
`Microsoft.NETCore.App.Runtime.android-arm` and download the `.nupkg`
for a given version if needed.

To find the commit of a given package, locate the `.nuspec` file
inside the `.nupkg`, and look for:

```xml
<repository type="git" url="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime" commit="7bd472498e690e9421df86d5a9d728faa939742c" />
```

This information is also visible on Windows if you have [NuGet Package
Explorer][nuget-explorer].

[nuget-explorer]: https://github.com/NuGetPackageExplorer/NuGetPackageExplorer

## Testing different Mono runtime pack versions

One common scenario that comes up -- how does one test a specific
dotnet/runtime build along with a .NET 6 Android application?

One way to do this would be to copy individual files on top of the
NuGet cache, such as:

* `~/.nuget/packages/microsoft.netcore.app.runtime.mono.android-arm/`
* `~/.nuget/packages/microsoft.netcore.app.runtime.mono.android-arm64/`
* `~/.nuget/packages/microsoft.netcore.app.runtime.mono.android-x86/`
* `~/.nuget/packages/microsoft.netcore.app.runtime.mono.android-x64/`

However, this is not the best idea, since there are many files in
these packs. It would be an OK approach if you only need to update one
file.

A second (better) way is to add this MSBuild target to your Android
`.csproj` file:

```xml
<Target Name="UpdateMonoRuntimePacks" BeforeTargets="ProcessFrameworkReferences">
  <ItemGroup>
      <KnownRuntimePack
          Update="Microsoft.NETCore.App"
          Condition=" '%(KnownRuntimePack.TargetFramework)' == 'net6.0' "
          LatestRuntimeFrameworkVersion="6.0.0-preview.7.21364.3"
      />
  </ItemGroup>
</Target>
```

`6.0.0-preview.7.21364.3` is a version from the `dotnet6` feed above,
and so you would also need an accompanying `nuget.config` file.

This could also be used with local or CI builds of dotnet/runtime by
copying `.nupkg` files to the `library-packs` directory of a given
.NET install:

* `C:\Program Files\dotnet\library-packs`
* `/usr/local/share/dotnet/library-packs`
* `bin/$(Configuration)/dotnet/library-packs`

The `library-packs` directory is simply an implicit NuGet feed that is
automatically picked up by the .NET SDK.

## Enabling Mono Logging

### The easy way

A quick way to enable Mono logging is to use the `RunWithLogging`
target:

```bash
$ dotnet build -t:RunWithLogging
```

If successful, messages printed to the screen will show location
of the logcat file with the logged messages.

Verbosity of logging can be increased by setting the `$(RunLogVerbose)`
property to `true`, in which case the log output file will contain
(very) verbose log messages from the MonoVM runtime.

By default, the target will wait for a 1000ms before it dumps the
logcat buffer to file.  This is to give the Android logging daemon
time to actually put all the messages logged by the application in
the logcat buffer.  This value can be overridden by setting the
`$(RunLogDelayInMS)` MSBuild property to a number of milliseconds that
the target should wait before creating the log file.

### The manual way

Since [6e58ce4][6e58ce4], logging from Mono is no longer enabled by
default. You can set the `debug.mono.log` system property to answer
questions like: Is AOT working? Is the Mono Interpreter enabled?

If you wanted to enable logging for AOT, for example:

```bash
$ adb shell setprop debug.mono.log mono_log_level=debug,mono_log_mask=aot
```

You could use `mono_log_mask=all` to enable all logging. See the [Mono
documentation][mono-logging] for more information about
`MONO_LOG_LEVEL` and `MONO_LOG_MASK`.  You can specify more than one
category as the value of `mono_log-mask`, in which case individual
categories need to be separated with `:`, for instance:

```bash
$ adb shell setprop debug.mono.log mono_log_level=debug,mono_log_mask=gc:asm:dll
```

There is further logging produced by `libmonodroid.so` you can enable with:

```bash
$ adb shell setprop debug.mono.log=default,timing=bare,assembly,gc,debugger
```

You can combine both together. The following would log nearly everything:

```bash
$ adb shell setprop debug.mono.log=default,timing=bare,assembly,gc,debugger,mono_log_level=debug,mono_log_mask=aot
```

To unset `debug.mono.log`, you can do:

```bash
$ adb shell setprop debug.mono.log "''"
```

You could also reboot the device or emulator to completely clear all
system properties.

The `debug.mono.log` system property can also be set in an
`@(AndroidEnvironment)` text file. However, the system property will
be preferred if it is not blank.

## Installing .NET MAUI

`make pack-dotnet` or `msbuild Xamarin.Android.sln -t:PackDotNet`
provisions a .NET SDK and locally built Android workload in:

    bin/$(Configuration)/dotnet/

If you *also* want .NET MAUI, you don't want to `dotnet workload
install maui`, because it will blow away your local build of the
Android workload.

To simplify things, we have an MSBuild target to install .NET MAUI:

    msbuild Xamarin.Android.sln -t:InstallMaui -p:MauiVersion=6.0.100-rc.1.1351

To find the version number of .NET MAUI you want to install, find the
package on the [nightly Azure DevOps feed][maui-feed]. Or look for the
`Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Maui.Manifest-6.0.100` package on NuGet.org for public
releases.
