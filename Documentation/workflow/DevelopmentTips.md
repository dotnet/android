Tips and tricks while developing Xamarin.Android.

# Update Directory

When a Xamarin.Android app launches on an Android device, and the app was
built in the `Debug` configuration, it will create an "update" directory
during process startup, printing the created directory to `adb logcat`:

	 W/monodroid( 2796): Creating public update directory: `/data/data/Mono.Android_Tests/files/.__override__`

When the app needs to resolve native libraries and assemblies, it will look
for those files within the update directory *first*. This includes the Mono
runtime library and BCL assemblies.

Note that the update directory is *per-app*. The above mentioned `Mono.Android_Tests`
directory is created when running the
[`Mono.Android-Tests.csproj`](../src/Mono.Android/Test/Mono.Android-Tests.csproj)
unit tests.

The update directory is not used in `Release` configuration builds.
(Note: `Release` configuration for the *app itself*, not for xamarin-android.)

For example, if you're working on a mono/x86 bug and need to quickly update
the app on the device to test `libmonosgen-2.0.so` changes:

	$ make -C build-tools/mono-runtimes/obj/Debug/x86 && \
	  adb push build-tools/mono-runtimes/obj/Debug/x86/mono/mini/.libs/libmonosgen-2.0.so \
	    /data/data/Mono.Android_Tests/files/.__override__

Alternatively, if you're working on an `mscorlib.dll` bug:

	$ make -C external/mono/mcs/class/corlib PROFILE=monodroid && \
	  adb push external/mono/mcs/class/lib/monodroid/mscorlib.dll \
	    /data/data/Mono.Android_Tests/files/.__override__
