#### Application behavior on device and emulator

- [Developer Community 1045818][0]: Starting in Xamarin.Android 10.3
  on Windows, errors similar to _Java.Lang.RuntimeException: 'Font
  asset not found Fonts/fontello.ttf'_ could cause apps to abort
  unexpectedly on device after they were updated and redeployed from
  Visual Studio on Windows. There is a [known issue][1] with the
  `aapt2` tool from the Android SDK that produces mixed path
  separators in the `.apk` for `AndroidAsset` files containing
  sub-directories. This scenario could cause the file to be missing
  after an incremental build.
