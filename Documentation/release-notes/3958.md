### Breaking change for `.exe` files

Since Xamarin.Android 9.4, `.exe` files are not considered at *build time* and are not included in the final APK for Xamarin.Android applications:

To improve startup performance, Xamarin.Android no longer probes for `.exe` files at *runtime*. A standard project type such as a `netstandard` library, Xamarin.Android class library, Xamarin.Android binding library, a [shared project][shared_project], or even a portable class library will not have a problem. Consider using one of the supported project types moving forward.
