### App startup performance

  * [GitHub PR 4302](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/4302):
    Avoid unneeded calls to `GetCustomAttribute()` during app startup for the
    common case where an app has no types decorated with the
    `[JniAddNativeMethodRegistration]` attribute.  Additionally, instead of
    using a managed method to propagate uncaught exceptions from Java, use a
    Java method that calls into the unmanaged Xamarin.Android runtime.  These
    changes reduced the time to display the first screen of a small test
    Xamarin.Forms app from about 730 milliseconds to about 700 milliseconds for
    a Release configuration build on a Google Pixel 3 XL device.
