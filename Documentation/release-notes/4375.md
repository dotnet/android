### AndroidExplicitCrunch feature removed

In previous Xamarin.Android versions, setting the
`AndroidExplicitCrunch` MSBuild property to `true` would configure the
build to [crunch][crunch-upstream] PNG drawable resources using a
separate MSBuild task before passing them to AAPT.

This feature was never compatible with projects configured to use
AAPT2 and was automatically disabled in those projects.  For projects
configured to use the older AAPT tool, this feature could cause builds
to rerun AAPT on every build.  Due to these limitations, this feature has
now been removed from Xamarin.Android.  Project authors who added this
property to their *.csproj* files in the past can now remove it.
