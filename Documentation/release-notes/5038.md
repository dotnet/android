#### Fix CollectNonEmptyDirectories to handle file collisions.

- [GitHub PR 5038](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/5038):
  Aapt2 would fail with missing resources when using ResizetizerNT and
  `google-services.json` together.

      error APT2260: resource drawable/icon (aka com.some.package:drawable/icon) not found.
      error APT2061: failed linking file resources.

  This is because they were both using the same file to track the directory contents. The build system has now been updated to ensure each resource directory has its own unique cache file.
