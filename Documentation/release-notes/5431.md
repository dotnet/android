### Binding Projects Nullable Reference Types Support

  * [GitHub PR 5431](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/5431):
    [Xamarin.Android.Build.Tasks] Enable NRT for bindings projects.

Adding `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>` to an Android Bindings project
that has `<LangVersion>` of at least C# 8 will cause the generated
code to include nullable reference types.  Many Nullable annotations from the
Java/Android ecosystem are supported. ([Supported List](https://github.com/xamarin/java.interop/pull/526))
