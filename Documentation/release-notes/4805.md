#### Application behavior on device and emulator

  - [GitHub 4805](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/4805):
    Starting in Xamarin.Android 10.3, localized resources from _.resx_
    files in Xamarin.Android application projects were no longer
    deployed when building and deploying from within Visual Studio to
    an attached device or emulator.  (In contrast, clean builds
    started via the **Build > Archive** command or on the command line
    worked as expected.)
