#### Application and library build and deployment

  * [GitHub 4790](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/4790):
    Fixes a build error such as _Error: can't open typemaps.x86.s for
    reading: No such file or directory_ after the
    `$(AndroidSupportedAbis)` MSBuild property was changed from a
    previous build.
