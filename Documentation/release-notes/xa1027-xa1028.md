### Application and library build process

- _error XA1011: Using ProGuard with the D8 DEX compiler is no longer
  supported... AndroidLinkTool ..._ could appear without clues about the
  responsible MSBuild property in certain cases where `AndroidLinkTool` was
  empty.  Xamarin.Android now provides additional XA1027 and XA1028 build
  warnings to indicate cases where one of the older `EnableProguard` or
  `AndroidEnableProguard` MSBuild properties is involved.
