### Build and deployment performance

  * [GitHub PR 5188](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/5188):
    Improve performance by lazily loading an Android resource mapping
    file that is only used for error messages. This reduced the
    overall build time by 348ms in a real-world project in an initial
    clean build or incremental builds with Android resource changes.
