### Build and deployment performance

  * [GitHub PR 4320](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/4320):
    Update to LibZipSharp 1.0.10 which uses `System.Buffers.ArrayPool`
    instead of `byte[]` to save on allocations.  This reduced the combined time
    for the `ResolveLibraryProjectImports` and `BuildApk` tasks from about 5.3
    seconds to about 5.0 seconds for a small test Xamarin.Forms app on an
    initial clean build.
