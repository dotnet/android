### Preliminary JDK 11 Support

Xamarin.Android can now use JDK 11 to build libraries and applications.

To do so:

 1. Install JDK 11
 2. Set the `$(JavaSdkDirectory)` MSBuild property to refer to the root
    of the JDK installation from (1).

#### Known Issues

When JDK 11 is used, the `@(JavaDocJar)` Build action is not supported,
and binding projects will not parse Javadoc to determine parameter names.
This may a change in parameter names.

This will be addressed in a future release.
