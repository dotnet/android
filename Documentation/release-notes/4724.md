#### Application behavior on device and emulator

  - [Developer Community 1030901](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/1030901/localization-in-android-doesnt-work-4.html),
    [GitHub 4664](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/4664):
    Starting in Xamarin.Android 10.3, localized resources from _.resx_ files were
    no longer deployed when building and deploying from within Visual Studio to
    an attached device or emulator.  (In contrast, clean builds started via the
    **Build > Archive** command or on the command line worked as expected.)
