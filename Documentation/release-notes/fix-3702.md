### XA1029, XA1030, XA1031 warnings and errors for duplicate resource and asset files

```
warning XA1029: 'Resources\layout\layout1.xml' is included in the project under duplicate names, once as 'Resources\layout-xhdpi\layout1.xml', and once as 'Resources\layout-xhdpi\layout1.xml'. Remove one of the duplicates to resolve this warning.
```

```
error XA1030: 'Resources\layout\layout1.axml' conflicts with 'Resources\layout\layout1.xml' because the file names only differ by file extension or capitalization. Please rename or remove one of the files.
```

```
error XA1031: 'Resources\layout\layout1.axml' with name 'Resources\layout-xhdpi\layout1.xml' conflicts with 'Resources\layout\layout2.axml' with name 'Resources\layout-xhdpi\layout1.xml' because the names are the same or only differ by file extension or capitalization. Please rename or remove one of the files.
```

These new warnings and errors aim to help project authors identify and clean up
unintentional duplicate Android resources and assets that might be included in
their projects.

One scenario that can produce unintentional duplicates is if an existing Android
layout _.axml_ file has been saved into a corresponding _.xml_ file to match the
latest recommended file extension for layout resources.  If the original _.axml_
file is by chance still present in the project alongside the new _.xml_ file,
the build will now fail with the XA1030 error message to help project authors
find that unintentional duplicate.

In general, to resolve these messages, remove any unintentional duplicates files
mentioned in the messages.  If both files are still needed, ensure that each
file has a unique file name, `Link` MSBuild metadata name, or `LogicalName`
MSBuild metadata name.
