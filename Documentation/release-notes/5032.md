### Tool and library version updates

#### apksigner from Android SDK Build-Tools 30.0.3 now included

Xamarin.Android now packages its own copy of the
[`apksigner`][apksigner] executable.  The current included version is
[aligned with Android SDK Build-Tools 30.0.3][apksigner-30.0.3].

Attempting to use the `apksigner` from Android SDK Build-Tools 30.0
with Java JDK 8 results in the following error (as mentioned in the
[Xamarin.Android 11.0 release-notes][xa-11.0]):

    java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: com/android/apksigner/ApkSignerTool has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 53.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 52.0

Using the `apksigner` packaged with Xamarin.Android will allow
Xamarin.Android to use Android SDK Build-Tools 30.0 along with Java
JDK 8.
