#### Application behavior on device and emulator

  * [GitHub PR 4582](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/4589):
    `ObjectDisposedException` could in theory be thrown during cancellation of
    `AndroidClientHandler` requests, depending on the particular timing of
    cancellation and object disposal.  The time window where this can happen 
    is now narrower.
