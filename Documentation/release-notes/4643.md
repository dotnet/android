### Add `$(AndroidAllowDeltaInstall)` MSBuild Property

The new `$(AndroidAllowDeltaInstall)` MSBuild property can be used to
enable the experimental delta install feature, where only APK
updates are deployed to the device, not the full APK every time.
Delta installs can be slightly faster.

Set it true to enable this support. But note that this feature is
currently experimental, just intended for testing and not yet
recommended for normal use.
