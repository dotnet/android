### Add `$(AndroidAllowDeltaInstall)` MSBuild Property

The new `$(AndroidAllowDeltaInstall)` MSBuild property can be used to
enable the experimental delta install feature, which computes a diff
between the currently installed APK and new one and only sends the diffs, not
whole APK, to the device. Delta installs can be slightly faster.
If delta install isn't available (the app wasn't previously installed
or the device is older than API 24) or the delta install fails, it falls back
to a regular install.

The default value is `false`. Note that this feature is currently experimental,
just intended for testing and not yet recommended for normal use.
