#### Application behavior on device and emulator

  * [GitHub 661](https://github.com/xamarin/java.interop/issues/661):
    Fixes a `TypeLoadException` that could result when an app is built
    with the API-R preview bindings, `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)`=v10.0.99,
    when instantiating a type which implements an interface which contains
    default interface members.

#### Application and library build and deployment

  * [GitHub 515](https://github.com/xamarin/java.interop/issues/515):
    Allow `.csv` files to declare C# enumeration members without requiring
    a corresponding Java field.

#### Android API binding

  * [GitHub 588](https://github.com/xamarin/java.interop/issues/588):
    Don't invalidate an interface binding if it contains a static method
    that couldn't be bound.
