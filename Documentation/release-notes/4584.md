### Minimum compatible Android version now Android 5.0 Lollipop (API level 21)

The minimum compatible Android version for Xamarin.Android apps is now Android
5.0 Lollipop (API level 21).  Warning XA4216 has been updated to help highlight
this change for any projects that might still have an older version set for the
`minSdkVersion` in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```
warning XA4216: AndroidManifest.xml //uses-sdk/@android:minSdkVersion '20' is less than API-21, this configuration is not supported.
```

#### Background information

The unmanaged native libraries that are part of Xamarin.Android are now built to
target Android 5.0 Lollipop (API level 21), so apps built using this release can
abort due to incompatible APIs if run on earlier Android versions.
