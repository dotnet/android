### Build and deployment performance

  * [GitHub PR 4395](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/4395):
    Remove temporary file usage in the `<ConvertResourcesCases/>` MSBuild
    task. This reduced the time for this MSBuild task from 613ms to 508ms
    in a real-world project in an initial clean build or incremental builds
    with Android resource changes.
