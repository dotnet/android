* [GitHub PR 4614](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/4614):
    Syntax errors in `AndroidManifest.xml` always referred to the generated
    version of the file (like
    `obj\Debug\90\android\manifest\AndroidManifest.xml`), even when the syntax
    error was also present in the hand-written input
    `Properties\AndroidManifest.xml` file. Manifest errors are now fixed up to
    point to the `Properties\AndroidManifest.xml` file. An additional note will
    be added to the message to inform the user that the issue might *not* be in
    that file, but might be caused by code.
