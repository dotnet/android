### Preview bindings for Android 11 Developer Preview 4

This version includes preview bindings for the [fourth Developer Preview of
Android 11][android-11-preview-4] from Google.  See the [Android 11 Developer
Preview documentation][android-11-upstream] for additional information about the
behavior and API changes in this new Android version.  To try the bindings for
the new APIs in a Xamarin.Android project, set **Compile using Android version:
(Target Framework)** to **Android 10.0.99 (R)** under the **Application** tab of
the Visual Studio project property pages.  This sets the
`TargetFrameworkVersion` property to `v10.0.99` in the _.csproj_ file:

```xml
<TargetFrameworkVersion>v10.0.99</TargetFrameworkVersion>
```
