### Tidier IntelliSense suggestions for Java.Lang.Object subclasses

`Java.Lang.Object` contains several properties and methods that are
required to be `public` to support bindings, but are not intended
to be called by users.  Use `[EditorBrowser]` to hide them from
IntelliSense, making it easier to find useful members.

### Issues fixed

#### IDE compatibility

  * [GitHub 4582](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/4582):
    Some `Java.Lang.Object` properties and methods like `Handle` and
    `PeerReference` appeared in IntelliSense suggestions even though they were
    primarily intended for use only in generated code.
