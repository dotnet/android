#### Application Mono Framework behavior on device and emulator

- [GitHub 4713](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/4713):
  Starting in Xamarin.Android 10.3, SIGSEGV during
  `monodroid_typemap_java_to_managed` could cause apps to abort if the
  application was built with the `$(AndroidEnablePreloadAssemblies)`
  set to `False`, that is assembly preload at application startup
  would be turned off and the application happened to use a managed
  type which resides in an assembly not yet loaded by the runtime.
