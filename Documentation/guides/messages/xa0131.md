# Xamarin.Android error XA0131

## Issue

The 'run-as' tool has been disabled on this device by the Manufacturer.
Fast Deployment requires 'run-as' in order to function.

## Solution

Either enable it by activating the developer options on the device or by setting 'ro.boot.disable_runas' to 'false'.
If you are unable to activate the developer options you can disable Fast Deployment by setting  `EmbedAssembliesIntoApk = True` in your .csproj. Or turn off `Fast Deployment` in the IDE.
You will still be able to debug on the device, all the required files will be packaged inside the .apk.
