# Compiler Warning XA1005

When [Layout Bindings and Code-Behind][code-behind] are enabled, this warning
will be emitted for every layout element that has the `//*/@android:id`
attribute set and uses a fully-qualified name for the element type.

For example, the warning *will* be emitted for both of the following elements:

```xml
<android.widget.TextView
    android:id="@+id/text1" />
<Android.Widget.TextView
    android:id="@+id/text2" />
```

But it will *not* be emitted for elements that use just an unqualified class
name like:

```xml
<TextView
    android:id="@+id/text1" />
```

The "naive type name fixup" tries to ensure that any fully-qualified type name
is a C# name rather than a Java name. First it checks a short list of known
mappings between Java namespaces and C# namespaces, such as the mapping of
`android.view` to `Android.Views`. For any remaining namespaces, it splits the
namespace on `.` and capitalizes each part.

To resolve this warning, change each element to use its unqualified C# class
name or add a [`xamarin:managedType`][code-behind-attributes] attribute to each
element that specifies the fully qualified C# name.

Example message:
- `warning XA1005: Attempting naive type name fixup for element with ID '@+id/text1' and type 'android.widget.TextView'`  
  `warning XA1005: If the above fixup fails, please add `xamarin:managedType` attribute to the element with fully qualified managed type name of the element.`
