# Compiler Warning XA4218

This warning indicates your `AndroidManifest.xml` file specifies
`//application/uses-library`, but the library was not found within the
Android SDK directory.

Solutions:

* Verify you defined the `@android:name` correctly and the file
  exists.
* Raise the value of `//uses-sdk/@android:targetSdkVersion` in
  `AndroidManifest.xml` to a higher API level.

Example message:

    warning XA4218: Unable to find //manifest/application/uses-library at path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk\platforms\android-22\optional\org.apache.http.legacy.jar
