# Xamarin.Android error XA0134

## Issue

The application does not have the 'android:debuggable' attribute set in the 'AndroidManifest.xml'.
This is required in order for Fast Deployment to work. This is normally enabled by default by
the Xamarin.Android build system for Debug builds.

## Solution

Please check that you to not have the 'android:debuggable' attribute set on the 'application' element in your 'AndroidManifest.xml'.
If you have a class that derives from 'Android.App.Application' and are using the '[Application]' make sure the
'Debuggable' property is not set at all as it will override the value for debug builds.
If neither of these solutions work please raise an issue at (https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/new/choose)[https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/new/choose]
