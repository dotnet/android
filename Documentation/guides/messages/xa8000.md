# Xamarin.Android error XA8000/IL8000

## Issue

```
Could not find Android Resource '@anim/enterfromright'. Please update @(AndroidResource) to add the missing resource.
```

## Solution

When trying to upgrade older nuget package references to use the
more recent Resource Designer Assembly, the system might encounter
fields which cannot be upgraded because the resource is missing
from either the dependency or the app.

To fix this issue the missing `AndroidResource` needs to be added to the application. Or the Nuget should be upgraded to use .net 8 or later.
