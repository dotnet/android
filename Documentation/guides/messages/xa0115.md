# Compiler Error XA0115

Due to the [removal of armeabi support in Android NDK r17][ndk-guide],
Xamarin.Android 9.1 is the last version that supports the armeabi architecture.
Projects that have this old ABI selected in the `$(AndroidSupportedAbis)`
property will need to be updated to remove it before they will build
successfully with newer versions of Xamarin.Android.  The newer armeabi-v7a ABI
should now be used instead.  The `$(AndroidSupportedAbis)` setting can be found
in the **Advanced** section of the **Android Options** project properties in
Visual Studio and **Android Build** project properties in Visual Studio for Mac.

Example message:
- `Invalid value 'armeabi' in $(AndroidSupportedAbis). This ABI is no longer supported. Please update your project properties.`
