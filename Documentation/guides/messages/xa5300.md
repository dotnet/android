# Error XA5300

The XA5300 error is generated when the required Android SDK or Java SDK cannot
be located during the build.

This can be fixed on the command-line by overriding either the
`$(AndroidSdkDirectory)` or `$(JavaSdkDirectory)` MSBuild properties:

This can also be fixed [within Visual Studio options][vs-sdk].
