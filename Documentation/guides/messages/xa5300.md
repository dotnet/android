# Xamarin.Android error/warning XA5300

## Issue

The XA5300 error is generated when the required Android SDK or Java SDK cannot
be located during the build.

## Solution

This can be fixed on the command-line by overriding either the
`$(AndroidSdkDirectory)` or `$(JavaSdkDirectory)` MSBuild properties:

This can also be fixed [within Visual Studio options][vs-sdk].

Consider submitting a [bug][bug] if you are getting this failure under
normal circumstances.
