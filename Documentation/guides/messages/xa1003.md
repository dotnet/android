# Compiler Error XA1003

This error will be emitted if the expected `.zip` file is not 
found when compiling the java code to dalvik. As part of the 
build process all the `.class` files will be zipped up into a
`classes.zip`. This file is then used by the dalvik compiler
to produce the code for the final application.

If the `classes.zip` file is missing it is likely you have an
error earlier in the build process. Please `Clean` and `Build`
you application again to correct this issue.

If the problem persists raise an [issue](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/new).
