# Xamarin.Android error ADB0030

## Example messages

```
error ADB0030: Failure [INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_INCONSISTENT_CERTIFICATES]
```

```
error ADB0030: The installed package is incompatible. Please manually uninstall and try again.
```

## Issue

ADB0030 means that you must manually uninstall your APK before you
can deploy your Xamarin.Android application to the attached device or
emulator. This situation can happen if you had deployed your
Xamarin.Android application in the past, but it was signed with a
different Android keystore file.

This message indicates that `adb` (Android Debug Bridge) reported an
INSTALL\_PARSE\_FAILED\_INCONSISTENT\_CERTIFICATES,
INSTALL\_FAILED\_UPDATE\_INCOMPATIBLE, or
INSTALL\_FAILED\_VERSION\_DOWNGRADE error. `adb` is part of the Android
SDK and is used internally by Xamarin.Android to communicate with
Android emulators and devices. Learn more about `adb` from the [Android
documentation][adb].

## Solution

Manually uninstall your APK from the attached device or emulator.

[adb]: https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb

## Implementation notes

Note that nothing in the open source xamarin-android repository
emits ADB0030, as features such as debugging and "fast deployment"
are implemented in the proprietary Xamarin.Android additions.
