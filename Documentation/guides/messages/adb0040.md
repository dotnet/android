# Xamarin.Android error ADB0040

## Example messages

```
error ADB0040: The device does not support the minimum SDK level specified in the manifest.
```

## Issue

ADB0040 means that you are trying to deploy to an emulator or device
that has an older Android version than what your Xamarin.Android
application supports.

This message indicates that `adb` (Android Debug Bridge) reported an
INSTALL\_FAILED\_OLDER\_SDK error. `adb` is part of the Android SDK and
is used internally by Xamarin.Android to communicate with Android
emulators and devices. Learn more about `adb` from the [Android
documentation][adb].

## Solution

Verify you are setting the appropriate values for `uses-sdk` in your
*AndroidManifest.xml*:

```xml
<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="15" android:targetSdkVersion="27"/>
```

Your attached device must at least be able to support `minSdkVersion`.

## Implementation notes

Note that nothing in the open source xamarin-android repository
emits ADB0040, as features such as debugging and "fast deployment"
are implemented in the proprietary Xamarin.Android additions.
