# Compiler warning XA0105

## Issue

The Xamarin.Android build will emit a XA0105 warning if it detects that one
of the referenced libraries or projects is using a `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)`
higher than the project being built. Using libraries which are targeting a
higher `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)` can cause unexpected results at runtime.
Especially when running on older devices.

## Solution

The fix is to increase the `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)` for your project to 
be equal to or higher than the referenced library projects.
