# Compiler Warning XA0114

As of November 1st 2018 any application update uploaded to the google play
store needs to target v8.0 (API 26) or above. If you are seeing this
warning, you should update the `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)` of your projects
to be v8.0 or above.

If you are not targeting the Google Play store and wish to hide these
warnings you can make use of the `/nowarn:XA0114` command line switch. 
Alternatively add

    <NoWarn>XA0114</NoWarn>

to your .csproj.
