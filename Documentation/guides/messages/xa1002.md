# Compiler Error XA1002

This error will be emitted when we are unable to find a matching custom new in the 
ResourceCaseMap string. 

As part of the build process `Namespace.CustomViewFoo` items in layout files are
replaced with `{MD5Hash}.CustomViewFoo`. We attempt to replace a couple of variants
of the `Namespace.CustomViewFoo`. One is the original casing found in the C# source
files. The other is all lowercase. If we cannot find a match we will do a case 
insensitive lookup to see if there are items which do match. If we find one this 
error will be raised.

We found a matching key 'Namespace.CustomViewFoo' for 'NameSpace.CustomViewFoo'. But the casing was incorrect. Please correct the casing
