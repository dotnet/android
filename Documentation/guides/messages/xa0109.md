# Compiler warning XA0109

This warning is raised because android version v4.5 no longer exists. As a result it
is not supported by Xamarin.Android. 

If you see this warning you should change your `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)` to be one of the 
supported [versions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/app-fundamentals/android-api-levels?tabs=vswin#android-versions).
