# Xamarin.Android error XA1031

## Example messages

```
error XA1031: 'Resources\layout\layout1.axml' with name
'Resources\layout-xhdpi\layout1.xml' conflicts with
'Resources\layout\layout2.axml' with name 'Resources\layout-xhdpi\layout1.xml'
because the names are the same or only differ by file extension or
capitalization. Please rename or remove one of the files.
```

## Issue

This message indicates that two `AndroidResource` or `AndroidAsset` items with
different on-disk file paths path have conflicting `Link` or `LogicalName`
MSBuild item metadata.  Typically, this means the `Link` or `LogicalName`
metadata for one of the items contains a typo.  For example, if a project author
copied the `Link` metadata from one item to the other to use as a template but
then didn't update the metadata for the second item, the two files would
unintentionally have the same `Link` name.

Situations where the error will appear include:

- Two Android resource items with different on-disk file paths have `Link`
  or `LogicalName` metadata that are the same or differ only by file extension
  or by capitalization.

- Two Android asset items with the different on-disk file paths have `Link` or
  `LogicalName` metadata that are the same or differ only by capitalization.

## Solution

If one of the items is an unintentional duplicate, remove it from the project.
Otherwise, update the `Link` or `LogicalName` for one of the conflicting items
to the desired new name.
