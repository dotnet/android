# Compiler Warning XA4305

The `CreateMultiDexMainDexClassList`, `CompileToDalvik` or `R8`
MSBuild task encountered a `multidex.keep` file that was not found on
disk. You can customize `multidex` settings for your Xamarin.Android
application by adding files with the `MultiDexMainDexList` build item,
which are combined into a final `multidex.keep` file.

To learn more about `multidex` and how it relates to Android
development, see the [Android documentation][android].

## Resolution

Verify you are not declaring a `MultiDexMainDexList` build item that
does not exist.

Consider submitting a [bug][bug] if you are getting this warning under
normal circumstances.
