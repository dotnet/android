# Xamarin.Android error APT2265

## Issue

The tool `aapt2` is unable to resolve one of the files it was passed.
This is generally caused by non-ASCII characters in the project name
or the path to the project.

## Solution

The best way to avoid this is to ensure that your project does not contain
non-ASCII characters.
For example if you create all of your projects in folders such as

`C:\Users\shÃ«lly\Visual Studio 2022\Android\MyProjects\Com.SomeReallyLongCompanyName.MyBrillantApplication\MyBrilliantApplicaiton.Android\`

you may well encounter problems with not only `aapt2` but also Ahead of Time
compilation. Keeping your project names and folder structures short, concise and
ASCII will help work around these issues. For example instead of the above
you could use

`C:\Work\Android\MyBrilliantApp`

Which is much shorter, contains no non-ASCII characters and much less likely to encounter issues.
