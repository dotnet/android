# Xamarin.Android warning XA1029

## Example messages

```
warning XA1029: 'Resources\layout\layout1.xml' is included in the project under
duplicate names, once as 'Resources\layout-xhdpi\layout1.xml', and once as
'Resources\layout-xhdpi\layout1.xml'. Remove one of the duplicates to resolve
this warning.
```

## Issue

This message indicates that two `AndroidResource` or `AndroidAsset` items with
the same on-disk file path have conflicting `Link` or `LogicalName` MSBuild item
metadata.  In some cases, this could mean that a manual edit of the _.csproj_
file unintentionally introduced an extra copy of the file name to the
`AndroidResource` or `AndroidAsset` item list.  In other cases, it could mean
that a project author added a second copy of the file name to an item list
intentionally and was planning to specify a unique name for one of the copies
via `Link` or `LogicalName` metadata but has not yet updated the metadata.

Situations where the warning will appear include:

- Two Android resource items with the same on-disk file path have `Link` or
  `LogicalName` metadata that are the same or differ only by file extension or
  by capitalization.

- Two Android asset items with the same on-disk file path have `Link` or
  `LogicalName` metadata that are the same or differ only by capitalization.

## Solution

If one of the items is an unintentional duplicate, remove it from the project.
Otherwise, update the `Link` or `LogicalName` for one of the conflicting items
to the desired new name.
