# .NET Android error XA4248

## Example message

```
error XA4248: Could not find NuGet package 'Xamarin.Kotlin.StdLib' version '1.9.0' in lock file. Ensure NuGet Restore has run since this <PackageReference> was added.
```

## Issue

The NuGet lock file has not been generated and thus Java dependencies from NuGet packages
cannot be resolved.

## Solution

Run NuGet Restore for the project to ensure the lock file has been generated.
