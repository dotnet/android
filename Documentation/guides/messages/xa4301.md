# Compiler Error/Warning XA4301

This message indicates a problem adding an Android native library (`*.so` file)
to your Xamarin.Android project's APK file during the build.

Situations include:

  - Xamarin.Android is unable to determine the Android ABI for the library.
      - If coming from an assembly reference, Xamarin.Android will skip this
        file and emit a warning mentioning the file.
      - If coming from within the Xamarin.Android project, Xamarin.Android will
        give an error mentioning the file.
  - Duplicate instances of native libraries were found.
      - Xamarin.Android will include the first entry in the APK and emit a
        warning indicating the duplicate file.

See the [Android documentation][abi-docs] to learn about Android ABIs.

[abi-docs]: https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis

Common causes:

  - The Xamarin.Android project contains either an `@(EmbeddedNativeLibrary)`
    or `@(AndroidNativeLibrary)` build action in a directory that is not named
    a valid Android ABI.
  - The Xamarin.Android project is referencing two Android library projects
    that contain the same native library via an `@(EmbeddedNativeLibrary)` or
    `@(AndroidNativeLibrary)` build item.

## Resolution

  - Place any Android native libraries within a directory in your
    Xamarin.Android project named with the appropriate ABI, such as
    `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, `x86`, or `x86_64`.
  - Remove any duplicate instances of the native library.
