# Compiler error ADB0020

```
error ADB0020: Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_NO_MATCHING_ABIS]: Failed to extract native libraries
```

## Issue

ADB0020 means that the built Android APK did not contain a matching
Android architecture for the emulator or device it was deployed to.

This message indicates that `adb` (Android Debug Bridge) reported an
error. `adb` is part of the Android SDK and is used internally by
Xamarin.Android to communicate with Android emulators and devices.
Learn more about `adb` from the [Android documentation][adb].

Note that nothing in the open source xamarin-android repository
emits ADB0020, as features such as debugging and "fast deployment"
are implemented in the proprietary Xamarin.Android bits.

## Solution

A solution is to add an additional architecture under the
**Supported architectures** in your project options.

You may also modify the MSBuild property, as in the following example
that includes all ABIs:

```xml
<AndroidSupportedAbis>armeabi-v7a;x86;x86_64;arm64-v8a</AndroidSupportedAbis>
```
