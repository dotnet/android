# Compiler Error ADB0050

This message indicates that `adb` (Android Debug Bridge) reported an
error. `adb` is part of the Android SDK and is used internally by
Xamarin.Android to communicate with Android emulators and devices.
Learn more about `adb` from the [Android documentation][adb].

Note that nothing in the open source `xamarin-android` repository
emits `ADB0050`, as features such as debugging and "fast deployment"
are implemented in the proprietary Xamarin.Android bits.

`ADB0050` is likely an error in the Xamarin.Android build chain, since
it means there was an absence of the `-r` flag during the
`adb install` command. Consider submitting a [bug][bug] if you are
getting this warning under normal circumstances.

An example message would be:
- `error ADB0050: Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_ALREADY_EXISTS]`
