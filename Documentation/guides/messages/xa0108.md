# Compiler warning XA0108

## Issue

This message indicates that the Xamarin.Android tooling was unable to determine the version of the `lint` tool.
As a result, none of the normally disabled checks which produce false positives will be disabled.

## Solution

Consider submitting a [bug][bug] if you are getting this warning under normal
circumstances.
