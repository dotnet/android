# Xamarin.Android error XA1030

## Example messages

```
error XA1030: 'Resources\layout\layout1.axml' conflicts with
'Resources\layout\layout1.xml' because the file names only differ by file
extension or capitalization. Please rename or remove one of the files.
```

## Issue

Before the build process sends resource file to the Android resource tools AAPT
and AAPT2, it first copies them to the intermediate output directory under
normalized names that follow the format required for those tools.  The
normalized names all use the _.xml_ extension and are all lowercase.  If two
files have the same name after normalization, then the build fails with this
error to prevent unexpected results.

## Solution

To resolve this error, change the name one of the conflicting files, or, if one
of the files is an unneeded duplicate, remove it from the project.
