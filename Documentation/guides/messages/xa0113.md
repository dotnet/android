# Compiler warning XA0113

As of August 1st 2018, new applications and application updates uploaded
to the Google Play store need to target v8.0 (API 26) or above. If you are
seeing this warning, you should update the `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)` of
your projects to be v8.0 or above.

If you are not targeting the Google Play store and wish to hide these
warnings you can make use of the `/nowarn:XA0113` command line switch. 
Alternatively add

```xml
<NoWarn>XA0113</NoWarn>
```

to your *.csproj* file.
