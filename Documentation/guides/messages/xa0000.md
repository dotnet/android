# Compiler Error XA0000

An unhandled exception (or error case) was encountered in one of
Xamarin.Android's MSBuild tasks.

Consider submitting a [bug][bug] if you are getting this warning under
normal circumstances.

[bug]: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/wiki/Submitting-Bugs,-Feature-Requests,-and-Pull-Requests

## Examples

* An exception was thrown and logged, including a C# exception stack
  trace showing where the failure occurred.

Solution:

Likely, the only option is to submit a [bug][bug].

* You are using a `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)` which cannot be mapped
  to a valid android api-level. 

Solution:

Check you have selected a valid `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)` and the
required android api-level is installed in
`$(AndroidSdkDirectory)\platforms`.
