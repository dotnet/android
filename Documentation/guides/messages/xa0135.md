# Xamarin.Android error XA0135

## Issue

The package is a 'system' application. These are applications which install under
the 'system' user on a device. These types of applications cannot use 'run-as'.

## Solution

The Fast Deployment system should have handled this particular error automatically
and used a backup installation path. However if you are seeing this error please file
an issue with the exact error message using the 'Help->Send Feedback->Report a Problem' menu item in Visual Studio or 'Help->Report a Problem' in Visual Studio for Mac. If possible attach a full diagnostic build
log to the feedback report as this will help us diagnose the issue.
