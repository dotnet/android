# Compiler Error XA0116

Xamarin.Android's build process extracts various `EmbeddedResource`
files from its assemblies during a build. These include internal Java
source files that are required for a Xamarin.Android application to
start successfully. A `XA0116` error would only be encountered if one
of these required files is missing.

Consider submitting a [bug][bug] if you are getting this error under
normal circumstances.
