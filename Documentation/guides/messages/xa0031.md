# Xamarin.Android error XA0031

## Issue

The Android SDK platform you are targeting only works with certain versions of Java.
If you get this error, it means either your Java version is too old or
is not compatible with the targeted android platform.

## Solution

Make sure you install a compatible JDK version.
