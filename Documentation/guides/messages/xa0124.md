# Xamarin.Android error XA0124

## Issue

Mono Interpreter does not support running on x86 devices.

## Solution

When attempting to use the interpreter, please make sure to disable 
the `x86` target by removing it from the `$(AndroidSupportedAbis)` 
MSBuild property in your project file.  This can be done conditionally
**only** when using the interpreter.
