# Xamarin.Android error XA1039

## Example messages

```
error XA1039: The Android Support libraries are not supported in .NET 9 and later, please migrate to AndroidX. See https://aka.ms/xamarin/androidx for more details.
```

## Issue

Outdated "Android Support Library" packages are no longer supported in .NET 9:

* `Xamarin.Android.Arch.*`
* `Xamarin.Android.Support.*`

The underlying Java libraries are no longer supported by Google since the final
28.0.0 release. See the [Android Support Library Documentation][support] for
details.

Some example prefixes of the newer, supported AndroidX packages are:

* `Xamarin.AndroidX.*`
* `Xamarin.AndroidX.Arch.*`

For more information about the Android Support libraries or AndroidX, see:

* [Android Support Library Documentation][support]
* [AndroidX Documentation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx)

[support]: https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/packages

## Solution

Remove all NuGet package references to `Xamarin.Android.Support` or
`Xamarin.Android.Arch` in favor of the new AndroidX equivalents.

This also can occur if you are using a NuGet package with a transitive
dependency on the Android support packages. In this case, you will need to
remove the package or contact the package author.

See the [AndroidX migration documentation](https://aka.ms/xamarin/androidx) for
details.
