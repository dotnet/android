# Compiler warning XA1000

This warning means there was a problem parsing a layout XML file
by the `ManagedResourceParser`. This is usually due to invalid or
incomplete XML. 

If the XML is invalid your project will probably fail to build. 
You should investigate any formatting issues with the specified XML file.
