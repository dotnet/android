# Xamarin.Android error XA0125

## Issue

This issue happens when you are trying to use fast deployment on a device which
does not support it. Fast deployment requires features which are not available
on devices running API 20 or lower. The Fast Deployment system makes use of the
[`run-as`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core.git/+/refs/heads/master/run-as/run-as.cpp#42) feature of the Android OS. This feature was either not available or had
limited capabilities in API 20 and earlier.

## Solution

Disable Fast Deployment by setting  `EmbedAssembliesIntoApk = True` in your .csproj.
Or turn off `Fast Deployment` in the IDE. You will still be able to debug on the device,
all the required files will be packaged inside the .apk.
