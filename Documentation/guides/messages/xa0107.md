# Compiler warning XA0107

## Issue

The Xamarin.Android build will emit a XA0107 warning if it is using a
"Reference Assembly" during the build, where it shouldn't be. These are sanity
checks that likely mean there is a bug in Xamarin.Android.

XA0107 means that a file such as *System.dll* located within the
Xamarin.Android installation is being passed as input to one of the following
MSBuild tasks:

- `<BuildApk />`
- `<ResolveAssemblies />`

## Solution

Consider submitting a [bug][bug] if you are getting this warning under normal
circumstances.
