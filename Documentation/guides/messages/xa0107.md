# Compiler Warning XA0107

The Xamarin.Android build will emit a `XA0107` warning if it is using a
"Reference Assembly" during the build, where it shouldn't be. These are sanity
checks that likely mean there is a bug in Xamarin.Android.

XA0107 means that a file such as `System.dll` located within the
Xamarin.Android installation is being passed as input to one of the following
MSBuild tasks:

- `<BuildApk />`
- `<ResolveAssemblies />`

Consider submitting a [bug][bug] if you are getting this warning under normal
circumstances.
