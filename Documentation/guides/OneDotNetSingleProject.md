# One .NET "Single Project"

One theme for Xamarin in .NET 6 is to simplify the cross-platform
experience between iOS and Android. We would like to provide
cross-platform alternatives to `AndroidManifest.xml` and `Info.plist`.
The eventual goal would be to remove the need for these files for
simple apps and project templates. Developers would only need to
create them when a less widely used feature is needed. We would need
to create item templates for `AndroidManifest.xml` and `Info.plist`
when (and if) they are removed from project templates.

The concepts for a Xamarin "single project" go much beyond this. This
document is a starting point for what needs to go in the .NET for Android
and Apple SDKs, while much of the remaining features would be in the
MAUI MSBuild targets.

For starters, we can add the following MSBuild properties to the
.NET for Android and .NET for iOS/etc. SDKs:

* `$(ApplicationId)` maps to `/manifest/@package` and
  `CFBundleIdentifier`
* `$(ApplicationVersion)` maps to `android:versionCode` or
  [`CFBundleVersion`][CFBundleVersion]. This is required to be an integer on Android and
  less than 10000 on iOS. This value must be incremented for each
  Google Play or App Store / TestFlight submission.
* `$(ApplicationDisplayVersion)` maps to `android:versionName` or
  [`CFBundleShortVersionString`][CFBundleShortVersionString]. This can
  default to `$(ApplicationVersion)` when blank.
* `$(ApplicationTitle)` maps to `/application/@android:title` or
  `CFBundleDisplayName`

[CFBundleVersion]: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001431-102364
[CFBundleShortVersionString]: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001431-111349

The final value that is generated in the `Info.plist` or
`AndroidManifest.xml` can be overridden at different times. The final
source of truth is determined in order of:

1. `Info.plist` or `AndroidManifest.xml` in the iOS/Android project.
2. iOS/Android `.csproj` defines the MSBuild properties. This could
   also be done in a .NET MAUI "Single Project".
3. The properties set by MSBuild via other means such as
   `Directory.Build.props`, etc.

Even if we did not complete the goal of complete removal of
`AndroidManifest.xml` and `Info.plist` from Xamarin project templates,
these new MSBuild properties would be useful in their own right.

## Opting out

.NET Core introduced `$(GenerateAssemblyInfo)` which defaults to `true`.
Projects migrating to .NET Core might set this to `false` if they have
an existing `Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs`. We should have a similar
property to disable the behavior.

`$(GenerateApplicationManifest)` defaults to `true` in .NET 6 and
`false` in "legacy" Xamarin.Android/Xamarin.iOS.

In most cases, developers would only use `$(GenerateApplicationManifest)`
if they want to try the new features in "legacy" Xamarin.

## Version, AssemblyVersion, FileVersion, and InformationalVersion

Since we are adding *more* version properties, we should consider
adding defaults to consolidate the assembly-level attributes when
using `$(GenerateAssemblyInfo)`.

The full list of defaults might be something like:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <ApplicationVersion Condition=" '$(ApplicationVersion)' == '' ">1</ApplicationVersion>
  <Version Condition=" '$(ApplicationDisplayVersion)' != '' ">$(ApplicationDisplayVersion)</Version>
  <ApplicationDisplayVersion Condition=" '$(ApplicationDisplayVersion)' == '' ">$(Version)</ApplicationDisplayVersion>
</PropertyGroup>
```

The dotnet/sdk defaults `$(Version)` to 1.0.0 and uses it to set:

* `$(AssemblyVersion)`
* `$(FileVersion)`
* `$(InformationalVersion)`

If we expect users to set `$(ApplicationVersion)` and
`$(ApplicationDisplayVersion)` in mobile apps, we can use the value of
`$(ApplicationDisplayVersion)` for `$(Version)` as well.

## Android Template

The default Android project template would include:

```xml
<!-- .csproj -->
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0-android</TargetFramework>
    <ApplicationTitle>@string/application_title</ApplicationTitle>
    <ApplicationId>com.companyname.myapp</ApplicationId>
    <ApplicationVersion>1</ApplicationVersion>
    <ApplicationDisplayVersion>1.0</ApplicationDisplayVersion>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>

<!-- Resources/values/strings.xml -->
<resources>
    <string name="application_title">MyApp</string>
</resources>
```

Removed from `AndroidManifest.xml` in the project template:

* `/manifest/@android:versionCode="1"`
* `/manifest/@android:versionName="1.0"`
* `/manifest/@package="com.companyname.myapp"`
* `/application/@android:label="MyApp"`

All values could be added later to the `AndroidManifest.xml` and
override the MSBuild properties.

## iOS Template

The default iOS project template would include:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0-ios</TargetFramework>
    <ApplicationTitle>MyApp</ApplicationTitle>
    <ApplicationId>com.companyname.myapp</ApplicationId>
    <ApplicationVersion>1</ApplicationVersion>
    <ApplicationDisplayVersion>1.0</ApplicationDisplayVersion>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

Removed from `Info.plist` in the project template:

* `CFBundleDisplayName`
* `CFBundleIdentifier`
* `CFBundleVersion`
* `CFBundleShortVersionString`

All values could be added later to the `Info.plist` and override the
MSBuild properties.

## Example

The .NET MAUI project template (`dotnet new maui`):

* `HelloMaui/HelloMaui.csproj` - multi-targeted for `net6.0-android`,
  `net6.0-ios`, `net6.0-maccatalyst`, etc.

Where the versions can be setup for both platforms at once with:

```xml
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <ApplicationTitle>Hello!</ApplicationTitle>
    <ApplicationId>com.companyname.hello</ApplicationId>
    <ApplicationVersion>1</ApplicationVersion>
    <ApplicationDisplayVersion>1.0</ApplicationDisplayVersion>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

In this project, a developer would increment `$(ApplicationVersion)`
and `$(ApplicationDisplayVersion)` for each public release.

## Localization

`$(ApplicationTitle)` can easily be localized on Android by using an
**AndroidResource** as the value.

However, on iOS you would need to specify
[`LSHasLocalizedDisplayName`][0] in the `Info.plist` and provide
`CFBundleName` or `CFBundleDisplayName` in a `.strings` file for each
supported language. For our first implementation, you would omit
`$(ApplicationTitle)` from the `.csproj` file if you need to localize
it.

One can imagine supporting a `.resx` key via a new
`$(LocalizedApplicationTitle)` property. This would likely need to be
implemented in .NET for Android/MAUI MSBuild tasks as a way to provide a
single `.resx` file to be translated to the appropriate format for iOS
and Android. This is a consideration for the future.

## Other Future Work

In future iterations, we can consider additional MSBuild properties
beyond `$(ApplicationTitle)`, `$(ApplicationId)`,
`$(ApplicationVersion)`, and `$(ApplicationDisplayVersion)`.

This is a list of additional properties that cover most of the
property pages in Visual Studio:

* `$(AndroidMinSdkVersion)`
* `$(AndroidTargetSdkVersion)`
* `$(AndroidInstallLocation)`
* `$(iOSMinimumOSVersion)`, `$(tvOSMinimumOSVersion)`,
  `$(MacMinimumOSVersion)`, and potentially other variants for
  Catalyst, etc.
* `$(AppleLaunchScreen)`
* `$(AppleDeviceFamily)` - `iPhone`, `iPad`, `Universal`, `TV`, and
  potentially other variants for Catalyst, etc.
* `$(AppleMainStoryboard)`
* `$(ApplicationIcon)`
* `$(ApplicationRoundIcon)` or `$(AndroidRoundIcon)`

Some settings would make more sense as an item group:

* `@(iOSSupportedInterfaceOrientations)` _iOS only_ - an item group
  that needs to support `UISupportedInterfaceOrientations` and
  `UISupportedInterfaceOrientations~ipad`
* `@(ApplicationPermission)` - an item group that maps to common
  permissions, similar to some behavior in Xamarin.Essentials.

To completely remove `AndroidManifest.xml` we would need to somehow
provide (or emit by default):

* `/android/@android:allowBackup="true"`
* `/android/@android:supportsRtl="true"`

To completely remove `Info.plist` we would need to somehow
provide (or emit by default):

* `LSRequiresIPhoneOS`
* `UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities` for `armv7`
