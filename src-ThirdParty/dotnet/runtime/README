The header files in this directory are verbatim copies taken from the
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/ repository. 

They can be found in the following locations in the repository:

  src/native/corehost/host_runtime_contract.h
  src/coreclr/hosts/inc/coreclrhost.h

and they MUST be in sync with the current version of the runtime being 
used. They don't have to come from the same version, but their content 
must be ABI and API compatible with it.
