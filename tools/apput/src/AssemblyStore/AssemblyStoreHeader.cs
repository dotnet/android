/// since it's possible that some of them will not be present in the future revisions of the
/// on-disk structure. No public property shall be removed, but any and all of them may be
/// `null` for any given version of the assembly store format. The only exception to this rule
/// is the `Version` property, since it is expected to be present in one way or another in all
/// the future format revisions.
