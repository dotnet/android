Description: Xamarin.Android libraries and runtime (host component)
 The best way to build native Android apps.
 .
 * Ship native Android packages. Xamarin.Android uses just-in-time 
   compilation for sophisticated runtime optimization of your app’s
   performance, meaning your app is a native Android APK.
 * Access any Android API, including new form factors. We bring 100% of 
   Google’s Android APIs to C#, enhancing Java APIs with async support 
   and .NET naming conventions so you feel right at home.
 * Call existing Java code from C#. Use your existing Java code, 
   frameworks, and custom controls in your Xamarin app using our 
   automatic binding generator.
 * Build Android Wear apps. With access to 100% API support for Android 
   Wear, create full-featured applications capable of running on Android 
   Wear devices.
 * Stay up-to-date with Android. Xamarin stays up-to-date with the most 
   current APIs from Google, so you can always use the latest features 
   in your apps.
