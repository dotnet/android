Xamarin.Android
===============

Xamarin.Android provides open-source bindings of the Android SDK for use with
.NET managed languages such as C#.

# Configuration.Overrides.props

The Xamarin.Android build is heavily dependent on MSBuild, with the *intention*
that it should (eventually?) be possible to build the project simply by
checking out the repo, loading `Xamarin.Android.sln` into an IDE, and Building
the solution. (This isn't currently possible, and may never be, but it's
the *vision*.)

However, some properties may need to be altered in order to suit your
requirements, such as the location of a cache directory to store
the Android SDK and NDK.

To modify the build process, copy
[`Configuration.Override.props.in`](Configuration.Override.props.in)
to `Configuration.Override.props`, and edit the file as appropriate.
`Configuration.Override.props` is `<Import/>`ed by `Configuration.props`
and will override any default values specified in `Configuration.props`.

Overridable MSBuild properties include:

* `$(AndroidApiLevel)`: The Android API level to bind in `src/Mono.Android`.
    This is an integer value, e.g. `15` for
    [API-15 (Android 4.0.3)](http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.0.3.html).
* `$(AndroidFrameworkVersion)`: The Xamarin.Android `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)`
    version which corresponds to `$(AndroidApiLevel)`. This is *usually* the
    Android version number with a leading `v`, e.g. `v4.0.3` for API-15.
* `$(AndroidSupportedHostJitAbis)`: The Android ABIs for which to build a
    host JIT *and* Xamarin.Android base class libraries (`mscorlib.dll`/etc.).
    The "host JIT" is used e.g. with the Xamarin Studio Designer, to render
    Xamarin.Android apps on the developer's machine.
    There can also be support for cross-compiling mono for a different
    host, e.g. to build Windows `libmonosgen-2.0.dll` from OS X.
    Supported host values include:

    * `Darwin`
    * `Linux`
    * `mxe-Win64`: Cross-compile Windows 64-bit binaries from Unix.

    The default value is `$(HostOS)`, where `$(HostOS)` is based on probing
    various environment variables and filesystem locations.
    On OS X, the default would be `Darwin`.
* `$(AndroidSupportedTargetJitAbis)`: The Android ABIs for which to build the
    the Mono JIT for inclusion within apps. This is a `:`-separated list of
    ABIs to build. Supported values are:

    * `armeabi`
    * `armeabi-v7a`
    * `arm64-v8a`
    * `x86`
    * `x86_64`
* `$(AndroidToolchainCacheDirectory)`: The directory to cache the downloaded
    Android NDK and SDK files. This value defaults to
    `$(HOME)\android-archives`.
* `$(AndroidToolchainDirectory)`: The directory to install the downloaded
    Android NDK and SDK files. This value defaults to
    `$(HOME)\android-toolchain`.
* `$(HostCc)`, `$(HostCxx)`: The C and C++ compilers to use to generate
    host-native binaries.
* `$(JavaInteropSourceDirectory)`: The Java.Interop source directory to
    build and reference projects from. By default, this is
    `external/Java.Interop` directory, maintained by `git submodule update`.

# Build Requirements

Building Xamarin.Android requires:

* [Mono 4.4 or later](#mono-sdk)
* [The Java Development Kit (JDK)](#jdk)
* [Autotools (`autoconf`, `automake`, etc.)](#autotools)
* [`xxd`](#xxd)
* [The Android SDK and NDK](#ndk)

<a name="mono-sdk" />
## Mono MDK

Mono 4.4 or later is required to build on [OS X][osx-mono] and Linux.

(This is because the build system uses the [XmlPeek][xmlpeek] task, which
was first added in Mono 4.4.)

[osx-mono]: http://www.mono-project.com/download/#download-mac
[xmlpeek]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff598684.aspx

<a name="jdk" />
## Java Development Kit

The Java Development Kit may be downloaded from the
[Oracle Java SE Downloads page][download-jdk].

[download-jdk]: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/

<a name="autotools" />
## Autotools

Autotools -- including `autoconf` and `automake` -- are required to build
the Mono runtimes.

On OS X, autotools are distributed with [Mono.framework][osx-mono].

<a name="xxd" />
## `xxd`

The [xxd][xxd] utility is used to build [src/monodroid](src/monodroid).
It is installed by default on OS X. Linux users may need to separately
install it; it may be part of the [**vim-common** package][sid-vim-common].

[xxd]: http://linux.die.net/man/1/xxd
[sid-vim-common]: https://packages.debian.org/sid/vim-common

<a name="ndk" />
## Android NDK, SDK

To simplify building Xamarin.Android, important pieces of the Android SDK
and Android NDK will be automatically downloaded and installed from
Google's website. Downloaded files are cached locally, by default into
`$(AndroidToolchainCacheDirectory)`. The Android NDK and SDK will be installed by
default into `$(AndroidToolchainDirectory)`.

The files that will be downloaded and installed are controlled by
[build-tools/android-toolchain/android-toolchain.projitems][android-toolchain.projitems]
via the `@(AndroidNdkItem)` and `@(AndroidSdkItem)` item groups, and the
URL to download files from is controlled by the `$(AndroidUri)` property.

[android-toolchain.projitems]: build-tools/android-toolchain/android-toolchain.projitems

# Build

At this point in time, building Xamarin.Android is only supported on OS X.
We will work to improve this.

To build Xamarin.Android, first prepare the project:

    make prepare

This will perform `git submodule update`, and any other pre-build tasks
that need to be performed.

Then, you may do one of the following:

1. Run make:

        make

2. Load `Xamarin.Android.sln` into Xamarin Studio and Build the project.

    *Note*: The `Mono.Android` project may *fail* on the first build
    because it generates sources, and those sources won't exist on the
    initial project load. Rebuild the project should this happen.

# Build Output Directory Structure

There are two configurations, `Debug` and `Release`, controlled by the
`$(Configuration)` MSBuild property.

The `bin\Build$(Configuration)` directory, e.g. `bin\BuildDebug`, contains
artifacts needed for *building* the repository. They should not be needed
for later execution.

The `bin\$(Configuration)` directory, e.g. `bin\Debug`, contains
*redistributable* artifacts, such as tooling and runtimes. This directory
acts as a *local installation prefix*, in which the directory structure
mirrors that of the OS X Xamarin.Android.framework directory structure:

* `bin\$(Configuration)\lib\xbuild\Xamarin\Android`: MSBuild-related support
    files and required runtimes used by the MSBuild tooling.
* `bin\$(Configuration)\lib\xbuild-frameworks\MonoAndroid`: Xamarin.Android
    profiles.
* `bin\$(Configuration)\lib\xbuild-frameworks\MonoAndroid\v1.0`: Xamarin.Android
    Base Class Library assemblies such as `mscorlib.dll`.
* `bin\$(Configuration)\lib\xbuild-frameworks\MonoAndroid\*`: Contains
    `Mono.Android.dll` for a given Xamarin.Android `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)`.

# Xamarin.Android `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)`s

Xamarin.Android uses the MSBuild `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)` mechanism
to provide a separate `Mono.Android.dll` *binding assembly* for each API
level.

This means there is no *single* `Mono.Android.dll`, there is instead a *set*
of them.

This complicates the "mental model" for the `Mono.Android` project, as
a *project* can have only one output, not many (...within reason...).
As such, building the `Mono.Android` project will only generate a single
`Mono.Android.dll`.

To control which API level is bound, set the `$(AndroidApiLevel)` and
`$(AndroidFrameworkVersion)` properties. `$(AndroidApiLevel)` is the
Android API level, *usually* a number, while `$(AndroidFrameworkVersion)`
is the Xamarin.Android `$(TargetFrameworkVersion)`.

The default values will target Android API-23, Android 6.0.

For example, to generate `Mono.Android.dll` for API-19 (Android 4.4):

    cd src/Mono.Android
    xbuild /p:AndroidApiLevel=19 /p:AndroidFrameworkVersion=v4.4
    # creates bin\Debug\lib\xbuild-frameworks\MonoAndroid\v4.4\Mono.Android.dll

# Samples

The [HelloWorld](samples/HelloWorld) sample may be built with the
[xabuild](tools/scripts/xabuild) script:

    $ tools/scripts/xabuild /t:SignAndroidPackage samples/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.csproj

`xabuild /t:SignAndroidPackage` will generate an `.apk` file, which may be
installed onto an Android device with the [`adb install`][adb-commands]
command:

[adb-commands]: http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html#commandsummary

    $ adb install samples/HelloWorld/bin/Debug/com.xamarin.android.helloworld-Signed.apk

**HelloWorld** may be launched manually through the Android app launcher,
or via `adb shell am`:

    $ adb shell am start com.xamarin.android.helloworld/example.MainActivity
