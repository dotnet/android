Compat issues with assembly Mono.Android:
CannotSealType : Type 'Java.Interop.JavaTypeParametersAttribute' is actually (has the sealed modifier) sealed in the implementation but not sealed in the contract.
MembersMustExist : Member 'public void Java.Interop.JavaTypeParametersAttribute.TypeParameters.set(System.String[])' does not exist in the implementation but it does exist in the contract.
